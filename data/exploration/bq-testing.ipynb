I've never designed anything based on arbitrary breakpoints (md, lg, xl and whatever numbers they might translate to) because that forces me to make design choices around those constraints.The only way to sanely add breakpoints in my opinion is to gradually reduce the width of your page and search for things that start looking off. Are your paragraphs starting to look a little cramped? Add a breakpoint at that width, maybe remove the sidebar, maybe lower paddings and margins to allow it to stay a little longer, maybe manually reduce font size or switch your column layout to rows if applicable. Keep doing that until you get to ~350px width and everything looks fine.

Hence, audio processing unit to cut as you go higher than your lowest decently loud frequency.The lowest cost option for this is about $230USD plus some electrical components (miniDSP 2x4HD).

This is the bible of classical electrodynamics, and everyone who works through either loves it or hates it (I loved it).I agree that there is a division between who loves that book (like the author) and the majority of the graduate students who had nightmares (and sometimes still gets). I like this goodreads review of the book [1]> A soul crushing technical manual written by a sadist that has served as the right of passage for physics PhDs since the dawn of time. Every single one of my professors studied this book, and every single one of them hates it with a passion. While I've no intention of becoming a professor, I still wonder, will my colleagues also inflict this torture on their students? Will the cycle be perpetuated ad infinitum? How many more aspiring physicists will we leave battered and bruised at the gates of insanity before switching to a textbook that seeks to make electrodynamics clear and intuitive rather than a mind-numbing trip through the seventh circle of hell?[1]https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/1266180525* personal note: If this book is really the bible of classical mechanics, then I'm atheist.\",\n",

I constantly return to it to reteach myself basic concepts or math. The problem with the text is that in order for it to be useful, you pretty much have to already understand the material. It's a dense, technical manual that, when paired with an easier to understand text such as Griffiths, grants tremendous power.

In other words, every single section of that reading list is based directly or indirectly on a diverse and sophisticated set of devices and measurement configurations (aka experiments). Also, most progress in our understanding the physical universe follows simply from inventing ever better probes and opening new observation windows.A computer analogy of the theoretical/empirical physics relation might be fun: You can spend your whole life writing application software and never even know what digital devices you are actually using. That\\'s totally legit. But if you want to write a new computer language (= a new theory) you most likely will have to dig into memory architectures and caches and all that stuff. If you want to dramatically increase the speed of computation (= a new observation window) you have to design a new chip. And if you want to go really deep and invent new computing paradigms, well then you need to learn quantum mechanics :-)In fairness, she does have a final sentence about that weird place calledlaboratory(= a place of labor).> And, finally, a note on learning in a laboratory vs. learning from textbooks. Physics is both an experimental and theoretical science, and while research happens in laboratories and on blackboards and computers, the majority of any physics education does not take place in a laboratory but in lecture classes that teach from textbooks and assign homework problems that are found in textbooks.My recommendation for a comprehensive intro into theoretical physics isThe Road to Reality by Roger Penrose.
