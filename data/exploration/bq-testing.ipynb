I've never designed anything based on arbitrary breakpoints (md, lg, xl and whatever numbers they might translate to) because that forces me to make design choices around those constraints.The only way to sanely add breakpoints in my opinion is to gradually reduce the width of your page and search for things that start looking off. Are your paragraphs starting to look a little cramped? Add a breakpoint at that width, maybe remove the sidebar, maybe lower paddings and margins to allow it to stay a little longer, maybe manually reduce font size or switch your column layout to rows if applicable. Keep doing that until you get to ~350px width and everything looks fine.

Hence, audio processing unit to cut as you go higher than your lowest decently loud frequency.The lowest cost option for this is about $230USD plus some electrical components (miniDSP 2x4HD).

Our proof relies on an explicit construction of\\na family of pairs of graphs with the same degree sequences and number of\\nbutterflies, with each pair indexed by a natural c, and such that any sequence\\nof rewiring operations transforming one graph into the other must include at\\nleast one rewiring operation involving at least c edges. Whether rewiring these\\nmany edges is sufficient to guarantee the full connectivity of the state space\\nof any such ensemble remains an open question. Our result implies the\\nimpossibility of developing efficient, graph-agnostic, MCMC algorithms for\\nthese ensembles, as the necessity to rewire an impractically large number of\\nedges may hinder taking a step on the state space.', 'Matteo Riondato', 'http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.10838v1', 'cs.SI', datetime.datetime(2023, 8, 22, 13, 0)), {'title': 0, 'summary': 1, 'author': 2, 'url': 3, 'category': 4, 'ct': 5})\n",

Such clashes between theory and experiment have often triggered decisive advances in physics. We can hope that some decisive advance is in the offing.Now, Wheeler was one of the most preeminent physicists of the 20th century and spearheaded several fields and was not afraid of wild ideas.

This was \"productionised\" onto a custom PCB:https://imgur.com/WM44RYl', \"There are plenty of projects for which solderless breadboards are unsuitable, but there are also lots for which they're perfectly fine.  Lots of hobbyists and most professionals will outgrow solderless breadboards sooner or later, but they're still a good place to get started.\", 'Spend an hour in an undergrad EE lab helping people with fucked up breadboards and you change your mind rapidly. Same goes for hobbyists but they don’t have someone to help them available.I’ve seen people chewed up for hours debugging a circuit and find it’s a breadboard problem.', 'Even more in-depth from the magnificent Ben Eater:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PE-_rJqvDhQ', 'I run an electronic lab at a university — I have the following tips:- don\\'t cheap out on breadboards unless you plan to manually test every single connection regularily before prototyping- with some breadboards the (red/blue) power rails are not connected all the way through, but only for half of the board, in doubt always measure. If this is the case with your board, just bridge the rails once and leave them bridged forever.- if you prototype projects more often get yourself sortiments (e.g. a resistors, film capacitors, ceramic capacitors, electrolytic capacitors). Yes, these sortiments are expensive, but my first private resistor sortiment lasted me for a decade and if you calculate a decade worth of \"fuck that part is missing\" it is a no-brainer. I literally never regreted getting those.- if you constantly find yourself using certain connectors build a (heavy) breakout-box for them. Something that doesn\\'t fly off the table easily. Having your breadboard fly of the table because your guitar is connected to it is bullshit.- there are limits to breadboarding. If you go high voltage, high current and/or high frequency or anything extra sensitive avoid it- learn how to translate between schematics and breadboards. Nowadays there are many breadboard-illustrations that show you exactly how to connect things. That is neat, but ot is hard to reason about circuits that way, and this will be needed once you deciate from what you find. Most interesting circuits will come as schematics anyways, so learning it is worth it- if you breadboard complex schematics, print out the schematic and tick off (with a pen)everyconnection betweeneverypin ofeverycomponent you make. It is very easy to miss something even for professionals. In the end a circuit is basically just nodes (a single pin of a component) and edges (the connections between them). If you get the topology right, the circuit should work. Exceptions: the schematic is wrong (not uncommon, there is a lot of crap on the internet), the parts are wrong (there is many nuances to each part, beyond their basic value) or the circuit is of a kind that is not suited for breadboarding (see above).- Sometimes people online claim that X works, but it only works because the part they had lying around had a very specific characteristic that they conceniently failed to mention. It is okay to just give up and move on at some point- Try to simulate schematics before you breadboard them. Change component values to get a basic intuition for the circuit. I like this one:https://www.falstad.com/circuit/circuitjs.html(it has some limitations, e.g. inverter based relaxation oscillators won\\'t oscillate, but for the most stuff this is fine)- don\\'t forget to add bypass caps. Just get a sack of ceramic 100nF capacitors and sprinkle them between plus and ground on the power rails next to wherever tou put active components (chips, etc)', \"Thanks for sharing.

Now consider a stateful server which you need to host (e.g. Kubernetes control plane / etcd) where you ordinarily cannot practice immutable infrastructure due to the stateful nature of the server.

The links, seemingly complaining about iOS or Android, don't really seem to clarify.It seems many want Unix technology or ideas to be about what Unix meant in the 70s and 80s and don't have much interest in moving things forward from that plateau. (To be clear, I thinkallthe major operating systems of today leave a lot to be desired, but each one has their own pros and cons.)Aside from the file system parts, my understanding of theideaof Unix is that it is a bunch of small utilities interacting with each other. I think almost anyone agrees with that idea, see functional programming and node based tools that link up data between dedicated functions and nodes, respectively. This idea is quite pervasive, and I don't think it was necessarily Unix that conceived of it. But in reality, the implementation of this idea in Unix leaves a lot to be desired. The collection of utilities that have very few standards in interfacing, documentation, naming, usability, and more importantly, data structures leaves one wanting. The idea that everything should be text is implicit and highly limiting. This is why programming languages that are somewhat OS-like and have their own scripting are so well liked, becuase it removes the need to worry about the various OSes' implementation of these ideas, leaving one to stay at a virtual machine level. For example, Elixir and the BEAM.It's typically viewed as blasphamous, but I think the PowerShell model is the more powerful one if we're just considering OS-level provided interactions.

Those oddly-named tools would be adopted by the small community without need for extensive documentation.

No.So we are short of the kind of increasingly mythical people with 20 years experience in some tech that came out yesterday, we’re short of people with IQ 180 and above with five diplomas, people with certain increasingly higher level of requirements.

It took long for the system to boot (around 45s on average at the time). They looked into it but also asked the question, why do people care about boot times at all? At this point, the systems were capable of sleeping, so reboots should be rare.They found that people were rebooting because of instability, not just once a day or once a week. While they did improve the boot times, they put more effort into making the OS more stable.

(Bear in mind that Microsoft was only a few years from launching its mega-hit Windows 95, while NeXT was struggling to sell computers.)During a conversation, Jobs told Slade he would find his talents wasted in Seattle. In contrast, Jobs called Silicon Valley a hub of excitement and activity where Slade could blossom.Jobs then launched into a spontaneous, impassioned speech. He described Palo Alto, California, as a “special place” and likened it to Florence during the Italian Renaissance. There was so much talent in the area, Jobs said, that you could walk down the street and bump into a scholar one moment, an astronaut the next.Jobs’ off-the-cuff description of the place bowled over Slade. It was a twist on Jobs’ famous pitch to Pepsi CEO John Sculley. (Jobs asked whether Sculley wanted to sell sugar water his whole life or join Apple and change the world.)After the talk, Slade agreed to pack up his stuff and move to Palo Alto.Jump forward a year, and Slade and his wife were eating in Il Fornaio, an Italian chain restaurant with a location on University Avenue in Palo Alto.“We were sitting there, in early ’91, and I’m reading the menu,” Slade recalled. “And on the back of the menu at Il Fornaio it says, ‘Palo Alto is like Florence in the Renaissance…’ And it goes through the whole spiel!

Especially in less solar friendly areas like Michigan.Lead acid is fine if you over compensate with panels. Lead acid will last longer in the cold than LiFEP04. Die hards will say you cant charge LiFEP04 in winter but I do. I accept the fact that my batteries will degrade faster. When you can build your own packs, its a lot easier to find which single set of cells went out and cheaper to replace. Its a risk I accept.If you are starting out, get a 200 Ah/hr LiFEP04 battery and 400 watts solar. Its a very good starting point for 12v and gives room for expandability.Avoid foldables. Avoid Harbor Freight. Avoid Jackery Solar Panels. You need Quality Panels.If you wanna learn more, check out Will Prowsehttps://www.youtube.com/@WillProwse\", 'I have recently gone down the solar panel rabbit hole too but I never tried the \"fancy portable mini panels\" cause they seem to weak and overpriced.Instead, I acquired two large 140W panels that had been removed from an old installation for the princely sum of $20 (USD).After struggling with trying to find connectors that I could pair with the MC3 connectors (remember, these panels came off an old installation), I bought a dozen MC4 and just cut off the old MC3 connectors...MC4 is the way to go these days.Next came the surprise at finding out about \"MPPT\" - in all my years looking at solar panels on roofs, I never knew they were so finicky about voltage vs current curves...real MPPT charge controllers start at $70 for a Victron 15Amp and I decided to try my luck with Chinese sellers on AliExpress...turns out the charger was a PWM fake sold as a MPPT charge controller.Anyway, I also needed a battery since the charger doesn\\'t work without a battery source. That\\'s another saga but short story - I built my own 3S battery pack out of 18650s.', 'What are you planning to power with your solar setup?You may be aware and this is 100% redundant but lifepo4 is a safer chemistry and small cells are becoming more affordable by the day. If there’s no risk of those 18650s overheating it’s fine I guess.', '1. Lead Acid is far cheaper, though its bigger and heavier than LiFePo. 12V @12Ah is only $35 from a brand-name (https://batteryinthecloud.com/products/ps-12120), and closer to $25 from no-name brands on Amazon.2. Modules to charge LeadAcid are so cheap, they don\\'t even make them. This specified PS-battery hsa a 13.5V to 13.8V \"standby\" voltage, meaning that 13.65V from the Solar Panel is all you need to have a UPS. Connect the 13.65V source from the Solar-panels to the + and - leads of the 12V battery, and volia. You get 13.65V when solar is available, and 12V from the battery when the solar cuts off. The end. Isn\\'t that easy?3. Grid-tie should be similarly easy, though I don\\'t have too much experience with it myself. IMO, buy a professional AC->DC converter, probably at 19V or some other suitable voltage and then get a DC-DC buck converter to go from 19V to 14.35V, and then a diode (0.7V dropoff) to hook up to your batteries in parallel. You\\'ll also need a diode in your Solar-panels cause you don\\'t want your Grid-tie system \"charging your solar panels\" (that\\'d probably create a fire and/or damage them...).Hobbyists should NOT deal with main-power themselves, but there\\'s a gross-many number of AC-to-DC converters available from $10 to $40.4. Don\\'t battery balance. Just buy bigger batteries. If 12Ah isn\\'t enough, buy a 20Ah battery. If 20Ah isn\\'t enough, buy a 33Ah battery, etc. etc. The limit is whatever you\\'re comfortable with (the bigger batteries give more current which can be more dangerous)', 'Don’t do lead acid. I say this from experience. Lead acid charges too slow. You want a battery that can capture every ray of sunshine - especially with intermittent sunlight - and charge at full speed. Lifepo4 can do this. Lead acid can’t.', 'A 12V 12Ah battery is 144Wh. I\\'m fairly certain that Lead-acid can accept 0.3C, and you\\'re right in that a 60W panel is slightly more than the 43W that Lead-acid can accept.But sizing 12V 20Ah (ie: 240 Wh), and now 0.3C is 72W or 6A of safe charging (less than 0.3C).-------------See #4: just buy a bigger battery if you need a bigger battery. Bigger battery provides more power and energy proportionally for the chemistry.And a 12V 20Ah lead-acid is just $40 on Amazon.---------I guess your overall point is that \"Trickle-charge\" isn\\'t enough for Solar? Which is something I admit I didn\\'t think about earlier (trickle-charge just doesn\\'t send as much current to the battery due to the lower voltage). But I guess there\\'s a \"simplicity of circuit\" advantage of trickle-charging. A more complex state-of-charge circuit (likely a microcontroller keeping tabs on the battery) is needed to safely send 0.3C down to the Lead Acid.EDIT: On the other hand, having your \"charge controller\" just be like, two power diodes, is a gross benefit to simplicity. Its something you can do with Lead-Acid that\\'s fully impossible with LiFePo (and is why LiFePo4 needs expensive charge controllers to work). For hobbyist purposes, there\\'s something to be said about using simpler technologies, even if their specs are worse (and I\\'m not entirely sure if Lead-Acid has worse specs than LiFePo4 in this use case).', 'The key issue is that lead acid at these low capacities may be able to take one or two amps above 50% SoC. Especially at 80%+ if the panel can do 4 amps but you can charge only with 2, you are wasting precious sunlight.Lead-acid can charge at 0.3C but only when empty until 50% or so. In the absorption phase, current drops (dramatically).Also lead-acid means 50% usable capacity for longevity so the 12v 12Ah lithium is 12v 24Ah lead-acid (minimum). Which also means you can never charge with 0.3C. And even then is longevity of lifepo4 so much better it’s not funny.Please spend the extra money on lifepo4, save yourself some headaches.', \"I like that this guy has been struggling with this for so long lolJust some random guy that I'm connected to via his frustrations\", 'I too feel the pain of starting a project possibly because someone feels they can do something for cheaper than a retail version. When pricing all of the components, this often looks to be the case. Oh how many times have I then had to buy things a second time or decide something else is needed once elbow deep into the project and many weekends later. If everything was calculated to include the amount of time invested, it would have been so much easier to just buy the thing. But something about pride or some such just won\\'t allow that to happen. We could wax poetically about the act of accomplishment and the self learning blah blah, but it\\'s pride.Edit: Just wanted to add the relevant quote: \"My only regret is that you can’t power the raspberry from frustration, because my levels are lately spiking so high, that I am continually wondering why isn’t reality bending around my hate.\"', 'I did a similar project a while back with a Pi Zero W, which has the perk of maxing at like 1w.

Only enough to cover less than two full days with little to no sunlight.The 50 watt panel is already small, but the non-mppt controller makes it even more inefficient.

We\\'re talking about battery backup, meaning the \"expected use case\" is that the Lead-Acid battery is sitting at near 100% capacity for almost its entire life, without significant amounts of discharge. Sure, you\\'ve got to discharge when the sun goes down but I don\\'t expect a properly-sized battery to be deeply discharged (especially when we\\'re aiming for multiple days worth of \"worst-case\" power, like multiple days of clouds/rain to reduce our power-collection).Lets just be dumb with napkin math for a second: 12-hours of charge, 12-hours of discharge on a \"typical\" day, with a 3-day / 72-hour period of worst-case charge. Where does this leave us?12-hours of typical discharge / 72-hours of worst-case discharge == DoD of 100% to 83% on your typical day-to-day basis.Hardly anything that considers a \"deep discharge\". And if we really need deep-discharges, most Lead-Acids can survive something on the order of 300x to 500x deep discharges right? So its not like the 5 to 10 times a year where you need all 72-hours of battery are significantly hampering your lifespan?> And even then is longevity of lifepo4 so much better it’s not funny.Measured in deep cycle-counts (ie: cell phones or laptop usage), sure.

But years of sitting on a float-charge, I don\\'t think its that much better than Lead-Acid.----------That being said, LiFePo4 is a \"superior\" battery for sure, and its much cheaper than I remember. But Lead Acid remains significantly lower-priced than LiFePo4 as far as I can tell (2-to-1 or less)I think you have a point about Lead-Acid charging slower when its near full (and keeping it full is key to keeping Lead-Acid long-lasting).

LiFePo4 does _NOT_ like topping charges or staying at 100% charge for long periods of time. Lead Acid however, prefers 100% charge and UPS use Lead Acids for this reason.LiFePo4, in UPS/Standby like systems, need to stop charging, and wait for the battery to be used before engaging in a new charge cycle.Lead-Acid on the other hand, can just have a constant voltage applied (ex: 13.5V or so) and you can just hold that indefinitely, for incredibly simple standby circuits.', 'I may be full of crap, it\\'s been over 15 years since I worked on this stuff.

There would be additional bonus points for having the bootloader stages flash QR codes containing the hashes of the next stages, which would enable very straightforward verification.With a secure element-based approach, the device would need to be able to convince adb that it has a genuine Google secure element and that the secure element says the fingerprint is such-and-such.

Anyone who receives the malicious image can query the binary transparency log to verify the image's authenticity. The user will find that Google has not added the corresponding image metadata to the log and will know not to trust the compromised image. Since publishing to the log is a separate process from the release process with signing, this raises the bar for the attacker beyond just compromising the key.So effectively, this seems to secure against malicious actors messing with Google's (or AOSP's)own build process, i.e. by somehow inserting an MITM between the build and the signing stage.I don't know how Google's or AOSP's build systems are set up, but I'd suspect that not many entities are able to mount a successful supply chain attack on internal networks.

So I don\\'t have an idea for an easy-to-implement design here.', \"Thanks to you asking why it's right to left instead of left to right, I have the opportunity to talk about some interesting design decisions. I agree there should be an organized pattern. For example, 1-30 lexographically. So I'll explain the hidden logic and pattern.The three necessary primes to represent on the organized lattice are 2, 3, and 5. Given a key like 16, each of these primes should be represented in its adjacent buttons, hopefully in an axis-like manner, because these are the consonant notes to it. Left of 16 is 5/4, right is 3/4, and up-down is 2 and 1/2. But why this way?Consonant pitches stay within a range - so large leaps in pitch are the least common. That means next to any number, the adjacent keys must have close by numbers. That's why the three primes 2, 3, 5, are converted to 2, 3/4, 5/4 - because these are the closest numbers to 1, after multiplying by a power of 2.Your hand has a harder time reaching vertically than horizontally. 2 is the largest of these three numbers, which is why 2x is on one of the 4 vertical directions, and 3/4 and 5/4 are on the horizontal directions. Furthermore, it means that 2x must be on the 5/4 side, not the 3/4 side - because this keeps pitch distances the smallest.There's only one remaining decision - why right to left? Your hand has an easier time turning inward than outward. And, whichever way it turns, the horizontal notes should have pitches as close as possible. Thus, 5/4 must be to the left direction.Luckily, divisors don't exist, so the fact that the 3/4 axis and 5/4 axis are on the same line - rather than 3/4 turning to 4/3 on the opposite side - is perfectly fine.So thanks to the above, the keyboard is forced to be this way, and every note is in its logical and rightful place, with no subjective choices. Except not, because there's not enough space. And because 7 and 15 can't be on the lattice, so they are just placed wherever there's room. 2 should really be below 1, and 3 should be where 2 is. 30 should be 40, etc. I tried to maintain the structure as much as possible but had to make things fit.\", 'Very cool work and explanation!', '> harmonics ascending from right-to-left breaks my brainIt\\'s not like instruments are totally consistent from one to another in how that sort of thing works.

Would be neat if the key labels would also indicate the absolute note so I wouldn't need to do mental arithmetic here.\", 'I don\\'t know how practical that is, but you can figure it out analytically.In equal temperament, you can find the frequency ratio of two notes in an interval by raising 2 to the power of X/12, where X is the number of semitones.Once you know that, you can look for some green numbers that, when divided, would have that same ratio.So to make a chord, you figure out the ratios. Here\\'s an example for major triads. First, some math to go from equal temperament to ratios. A major third is 4 semitones, so that\\'s 2*(4/12), and a perfect fifth is 7 semitones, so that\\'s 2*(7/12). Those work out to 1.2599 and 1.4983.They\\'re really \"supposed\"[1] to be 1.25 and 1.5, i.e. 5/4 and 3/2.So now that you know these ratios, you can look for 3 numbers that satisfy the two ratios. If you change 3/2 into 4/6, then it becomes pretty clear that 4 and 5 will satisfy the 5/4 ratio (giving you a major third) and that 4 and 6 will satisfy the 6/4 ratio (giving you a perfect fifth). So to get a major triad, you can play 4, 5, and 6.With similar reasoning, you can figure out that 10, 12, and 15 form a minor triad.----[1] If you look at equal temperament as a compromise that doesn\\'t get quite the \"right\" ratios.', 'If you know your chord\\'s format in just intonation, there\\'s a (not-so-)secret converter.

Maybe I should make this clearer by adding a text box.EDIT: thanks to your feedback, I added a textbox below the keyboard. It will show how to play things if you can write the ratios of the notes.

Takes me back to my undergrad days studying Ben Johnston’s JI systems for my own compositions.', 'This is really interesting and creative! Did you deliberately make some notes sit outside of the standard 440hz diatonic scale? Even when I click your Debussy demo, you’re hitting some notes outside of the normal 440hz scale!', \"With the design of this keyboard, only one note (maximum) can be in tune with the 440Hz equal temperament tuning, at least apart from octaves. No complicated proof of this is necessary since the ratio between any two notes in equal temperament is irrational and every note combination on this keyboard is rational. The irrationality of equal temperament is likely part of the reason why equal temperament was no common until relatively recently in human history.I think the example also highlights why equal temperament is pretty good if you can't change tuning on the fly. Certain keys (the musical theory kind, not the keyboard kind) will sound completely different. At least equal temperament is equally out of tune from just intonation (how singers and instruments with variable pitch tune chords) for every key.Something from the well-tempered clavier by Bach would likely work a lot better as a demonstration because it doesn't stray nearly as far from the home key. You could also make it work better by maybe adding in some keybindings to adjust the key like harps use. You probably wouldn't even need to add in 12 modes for it since harmonically related keys still work pretty well. Keys like F and Bb work well together because they are close on the circle of fifths, but F and B (natural) will not since they are basically as far apart as possible.\", \"So, there are two things currently going on with the Debussy example.The first is, yes, some of the notes from Debussy are actually poorly playable on the piano. One is this:https://i.imgur.com/K0Wuu3Q.png. This is a visualization I built (and which can't be ported to web easily, so unfortunately it's just something I have for now). It's like a scrolling player piano with rising notes, and the numbers next to the bars are what the numerators are. Note there are two 7s in the middle, and pianos are not good at 7s. I've verified these numbers are correct manually, so it's supposed to sound like that and the piano has an inaccurate approximation. This corresponds to this location in the score:https://i.imgur.com/24XY8vR.pngThe second is, I suspect there is a mistake near the end. This visualization overlaps the original with the twelve-tone version:https://i.imgur.com/tS7WzRg.png. Note how some of the bars are separated from each other. I'm currently in the process of checking these notes. My original 12ET -> Just Intonation conversion was automatic and I fixed up all the errors I could find, but I could have missed one. EDIT: yes, there was. I fixed it now.The third doesn't happen in this example, but sometimes composers want to deliberately round, such as in the Circle of Fifths. That would create unpleasant commas. I'm kind of lucky that it didn't happen in the demo I chose. The Circle of Fifths is not actually an issue; first, you can't keep old notes persistent across the whole circle; they will interfere. And second, thanks to Diana Deutsch's experiments on pitch memory, we know that if there are more than 16 notes between the old and new note, you shouldn't be able to discern the comma. However, although the Circle is not a big deal, other rounding intervals can become an issue, like 63/64, where the composer would like the rounding to occur somewhere other than the exact pitch repeat. Listeners are effective at detecting when an exact pitch repeat is slightly inexact, while they have a harder time discerning slightly-off harmonies.\", 'To specify, the pitch gets wonky on the first melodic phrase after you introduce the first 4 chords.

If you play the 3rd two octaves up, all of the harmonics match with all of the harmonics in the root frequency. Same if you play major 7th three octaves up.The 2 octaves up major 3rds harmonics are 5,10,15,20,… multiples of root. 3 octaves up major 7th are 15,30,45,… multiples of root.

In MIDI, like in most strictly-musical encodings, notes are specified in terms of semitones, with cents modifying those values. A cent is defined as 1% of a semitone. With a tuning reference (f), like 432 Hz, we can calculate the frequency a number of steps away with this handy function:f\\' = f * 2 ^ (i / 12)where \\n  f\\' = frequency to be solved, \\n  f = reference frequency\\n  i = steps/interval (semitone distance from reference)This works with micro-semitones, and/or negative values. So for example, if we want to know what 1.5 steps above 432 Hz is we would plug in the variables:f\\' = 432 Hz * 2 ^ (1.5 / 12) ~= 471.0993 HzIn the case where you know frequencies, and want to get the semitone steps, you\\'re taking the base 2 log.

Describe to me what happens when you throw sugar in coffee\\n   2. Describe the same thing in terms of atoms. \\n   3. Is this an example of entropy decreasing? \\n   4. What if the arrow of time was reversed. Describe what happens again at the atomic level. \\n   5. What if there were two regions in space one with increasing entropy and another with decreasing entropy. I place the coffee cup such that one half is in one region the other half is in the other region. What happens?Each answer displayed astonishing understanding of what occurs. This was the final answer to the fifth question:-----------------------------------------------\\n\\n   The scenario you\\'ve proposed is purely hypothetical and quite speculative because it defies our current understanding of the laws of physics, particularly the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which stipulates that entropy in an isolated system tends to increase. Nevertheless, it\\'s a fascinating thought experiment. Here\\'s what might happen if you had a cup of coffee straddling two such regions:\\n   \\n   The Increasing Entropy Region:\\n\\n    Dissolution and Distribution: On this side, sugar would behave as it does in our observable universe. It would dissolve in the coffee and disperse randomly throughout the half of the liquid.\\n\\n    Mixing and Thermal Energy: Molecules in this region would continue to collide and interact based on thermal motion, contributing to faster dissolution and dispersion of sugar.\\n\\n    Sweetening: The coffee in this half would become sweet as the sugar molecules interact with the liquid and dissolve.\\n\\n   The Decreasing Entropy Region:\\n\\n    Reforming Crystals: On this side, dissolved sugar would spontaneously start forming sugar crystals, leading to a decreasing level of entropy.\\n\\n    Unmixing: The sugar would start to separate from the coffee and move to form a distinct layer or solid chunks, further decreasing entropy in that half.\\n\\n    Unsweetening: Any sweetness initially imparted to this side would disappear as sugar molecules revert to a more ordered state.\\n\\n   Challenges:\\n\\n    Interface: The most mysterious part would be at the interface where the two regions meet. Would a sugar molecule crossing from the increasing to the decreasing entropy region suddenly reverse its course? Would there be some form of \"entropy gradient\" or \"entropy tension\" at the boundary? This part is extremely speculative and likely paradoxical.\\n\\n    Energy Conservation: Energy conservation laws might become complicated here. The energy required for sugar to crystallize in the decreasing entropy zone would have to come from somewhere, and how this balances with the increasing entropy side would pose a significant scientific puzzle.\\n\\n    Thermodynamic Anomalies: The coffee cup itself would be under very peculiar thermodynamic conditions, subject to two entirely different sets of rules. The temperature might behave inconsistently across the boundary, and heat exchange would likely be disrupted in perplexing ways.\\n\\n    Taste Experience: If you were to taste the coffee, each half of the cup would offer a radically different experience, one sweet and the other likely reverting back to its original unsweet state.\\n\\n    Perceptual Paradox: From a human perception standpoint, witnessing sugar both dissolve and crystallize in the same cup of coffee would be a profound and likely disorienting experience.\\n\\n    Time\\'s Arrow: This set-up implicitly questions the nature of time itself. Time seems to behave differently on each side, challenging our deepest notions about causality, sequence, and even reality.\\n\\n   Again, it\\'s worth noting that this scenario conflicts with our current understanding of physics, but it\\'s a fascinating avenue for speculative thought. Such a universe, if it could exist, would fundamentally challenge our understanding of physical laws and reality as we know it.\\n\\n   -------------------------------------------------This answer here is anything but a magic trick. It shows deep understanding of conceptual reality by answering complex questions that are unlikely to exist anywhere else on the internet. The AI literally talked about the mysterious interface without me prompting it at all. It knows the conceptual consequence of two regions of space side by side with differing levels of entropy. The answer is not simply a trick of the next best language token.Is it a practical answer? No. Because the question itself isn\\'t practical. But a non-practical answer does not make this answer a parlor trick.The entire internet is dismissing this thing as a parlor trick because LLMs fail to add large numbers. I mean come on man. You don\\'t need to be able to do math like a calculator in order to \"understand\" things.AI is not yet completely practical. That much is true. However, it is clearly No longer a parlor trick and it is getting closer and closer to transitioning into practical. When that day comes.... Good luck to us all.', 'Talking about mixing coffee with sugar/milk and reversing the arrow of time (ie. entropy) is a widely talked about example.That said, I agree with your arguments and conclusions.

More intelligent organisms build more elaborate models of the world using better developed senses in order to do so.\\n    \\n    Humans model the world primarily with language, which allows us to share our models with each other, across both space and time! Without language, it is extraordinarily more difficult to communicate complex abstract thoughts. As a side effect of our high level of intelligence, our wetware is capable of modeling things outside of language, such as mathematics. [...]\\n    \\n    In general, I think we need to stop equating intelligence with consciousness, agency, moral value, and living things. These are entirely different concepts, and, as a species, we are blinded by our egotistical identity of being smarter than the other animals.According to my definition, intelligence is actually all around us. We are blind to it because we focus only on how intelligence manifests in humans (defined by by our specific social organization and biological senses), and then use that as a benchmark to judge every other thing in the world.A less socially-charged definition of intelligence would make it easier to compare intelligence across living and non-living processes, though it would not be \"popular science\" useful for ranking humans.', \"Sure, it's neat that it can do those things... still I don't think that I'm exactly ready to toss aside books written by humans in favor of AI-generated alternatives.\", 'Writers have started using AI-generated ideas to help them write books.Same with code.

When this occurs and regulation inevitably catches up the disruption turns out to no longer be as able to beat the incumbents as thought.Sidestepping of regulation is often achieved because regulators don\\'t care too much about regulating your disrupting innovation, the level of care that regulators have regarding innovations in their industry can be measured by how central the industry to the orderly functioning of society and the normal flow of power within it.As an example - people don\\'t care that much about the regulation of taxis and hotels because they don\\'t really mean shit in the grand scheme of things.

But then, unbeknownst to the client, they disappear and leave the work to juniors.This is so ubiquitous that, earlier this year, I decided to change my career aspirations. I'd long wanted to be an agency leader, but the pattern above was repeated at every successful agency I came across, and it's not something I can stomach any longer.So, I decided to put myself out there as the expert. I write a newsletter. I published a book. I'm pursuing speaking engagements. Just like the other consultants do.However, I don't pass my clients onto anyone else. They're hiring me. They were sold on my expertise, so my expertise is what they're going to get.When a project grows too big for one person to handle, or when there are aspects of the work that don't justify my high hourly rate, I transparently inform my clients of my intention of bringing on freelancers for those aspects. It's all done out in the open.And while I do charge a markup on the work my subcontractors do on my behalf, it works out to far less than my hourly rate, and my clients are fully aware of the markup being charged and what value I'm providing in return (i.e.: supervision).All of which is to say: I think consultants can provide incredible value. (I know, I know... a consultant who believes on consulting. Shocking!) But you do have to be careful, and oddly enough, the bigger and more reputable the consulting firm, the less I would trust them. The business rewards bad players.\", \"You're still overseeing other subcontractors. My next step is likely in a similar direction but I want to start out with a couple of former colleagues in more of a partnership role.IMO being responsible for other people is tiring and unrewarding, I just want a structure to tackle interesting projects without a middleman.\", \"You run into scalability limits pretty quickly. Unless you are truly the world expert on weird ball bearing failures or whatever. Or can genuinely speak or do consulting days that clients will line up to pay you $20K+ per day to do. (And even that isn't all that much absent a pretty full dance card. Just how the math works.)\", \"> IMO being responsible for other people is tiring and unrewarding, I just want a structure to tackle interesting projects without a middleman.You're not wrong, but that's also only a problem to you, not the client. So it's not an ethics question, but a matter of what you enjoy doing. All the power to you if you sort that out.If I put myself in the shoes of my clients: They want their problems to be solved in a cost-effective way. They don't mind paying a premium for genuine expertise, because they see the value. But they WOULD have a problem paying that premium if it turned out that I was quietly passing on the work to people without the same expertise.Most projects don't need expertise for every aspect, or can't justify the budget needed for true expertise at each level.For example, let's say you're building a website. There are several functions involved in that:- Planning- Information Architecture- Copywriting- Design- Front-End Development- Back-End Development- InfrastructureIf your client is a major corporation, there's an argument to be made for expertise at every one of those levels. So they pay for that expertise. But what's galling is how rarely they actually receive that expertise, because even though they get face time with the experts, the work is being done by juniors, often without the client's awareness.If your client is a small company, the problem isn't with getting the expertise they paid for, but with only paying for the expertise they actually need.The advice I give to my clients is to focus on the planning and copywriting, because those, in my opinion and experience, are what make the biggest impact on whether or not your website will be an effective sales tool for your company. Invest there first, and if you need to hire juniors for the rest, hire juniors for the rest. Or hire me and I'll hire the juniors so you don't need to worry about it.What agencies and consulting firms do, however, is charge expertise-level rates for every aspect of the project, even though 80% of it is being done by junior-level people. This, to me, is dishonest, and is what I'm trying to avoid as a consultant.\", 'I worked at an MBB for a few years.

There are ~3 categories of language based on their use of affixes: analytic, agglutinating, and synthetic.This approach completely ignores analytic languages which put their complexity in word order instead of affixes, and it ignores the distinction between agglutinating vs synthetic language which stack up affixes vs combining multiple affixes into a single new affix respectively.It also misinterprets what people mean when they say languages which collide “reduce complexity” which really means they tend to become more analytic.  Nobody expected the Scandinavian languages to have this characteristic because they’ve been in the process of diverging from a common language.The process they’re referencing applies to languages which come from the collision of distinct languages, such as pidgins and creoles.

There\\'s an age-old debate about whether grammar is prescriptive or descriptive. I\\'m in the latter camp, which is to say that if enough people say something \"wrong\" then it\\'s not wrong anymore.Education however tends to be prescriptive. It teaches and maintains an existing way of using a language, so much so that in some places the colloquial and \"official\" versions of a language are esentially two different languages. The \"many linguists\" here ascribe this to a \"society of strangers\". I think the reality is that absence of a central authority means languages tend to change faster and thus lose unnecessary complexity.English is a great example of this. English is a Germanic language. Old English and Old German are very similar languages. After the Norman invasion in 1066, hte official language of the English court became French and remained so for ~300 years. This was the period of MIddle English.After this came early Modern English (eg Shakespeare). While Old English is essentially unintelligble to the modern English speaker, a lot of Middle English can be understood.But that 300 year period made English grammarmuchsimpler. Most cases disappeared. Word order became fixed. Noun gender mostly disappeared (other than pronouns for people). The subjunctive mood mostly disappeared (eg \"If I were king\" instead of \"if I was king\" is about the extent of modern English subjuntive mood). The last vestige of genitive is mostly just adding \"\\'s\" to things (with a few exceptions of course).English spelling and phoentics is of course a complete mess. So are tenses. But absent central authority we stopped having to know that a table was \"he\" and a chair was \"she\" (made up examples; I don\\'t know their gender in Old English). Isn\\'t that interesting?', 'Norman French, the official language of the English court became Norman French.Different from say Parisian French.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anglo-Norman_language', \"Yeah, we're still suffering from that mess in Swedish; ett bord (table), en stol (chair).

But I\\'ve never been really able to \\'read\\' a codebase, and I don\\'t really understand what people who do this are doing.My technique for getting to know a codebase is to look at one thing in particular, probably with the help of a debugger, tracing the call stack and how the data flows and changes. I get to know a whole project in sections, focusing on individual bits of functionality.And if I\\'m honest, I rarely ever \\'read\\' code this way either - I usually do it because I want to add a feature or improve performance, or squash a bug, and I stop when I understand enough to be fairly sure I\\'m doing things in a responsible manner - keeping with the architecture and not making what I leave when I\\'m done any more additionally complex than is required to accomplish my task.I don\\'t understand how people can \\'read code\\' in any sort of a straightforward manner. The phrasing seems to suggest to me a linear \\'reading\\' like a book or a technical manual. But you can\\'t read code like that. If a project is of even moderate size, there are too many interweaved dependencies. Even a very well factored codebase is at best a top-down or bottom-up tree, and you (or, at least, I) often can\\'t understand the trunk without understanding the disparate branches and leaves. I generally can\\'t keep all that in my head without a task to focus on.I think it\\'s arguably even irresponsible to suggest to newcomers that they should \\'read code\\' because it sets them up for failure when they try to do it and the complexity inevitably overwhelms them.Do I misunderstand what people mean when they say \"read code\"?', 'I think that some codebases can lend themselves to be read more than others. Consider for example GNU cat[0] vs. Plan9\\'s[1], from which one can infer the overall readability of the two projects.In particular, codebases who are composed of small, well-isolated components, can be read one chunk at a time, like a book. But I wouldn\\'t be surprised for most \"professional grade\" codebases to consist of organic, \"cluttered\" aggregate.

In this last case, curiosity might push you to read the code more deeply, compare different codebases, etc.Finally, some languages also are more prone to enforce locality than others, impacting readability.

That would include Haskell monads, at least those expressed in the usual way as type constructors, to the extent that Haskell types model sets.And you can see that the \"strength\" operation relies on the existence of tuples behaving like Cartesian products of sets. Such objects might not exist in other categories.', 'I don’t think ‘strength’ requires a Cartesian product. I was under the expression that any tensor product was sufficient, some of which lack Cartesian structure.', '\"I don\\'t see how this helps anyone\" is my gut response to anything related to the m-word', 'Monads are just a way to bind a continuation to an expression.The only reason they sound special is the silly name and the inane Haskell syntax.', 'I find this to be an odd take. Monads, even when restricted to programming language usage, do not fundamentally have anything to do with continuations. There is a Continuation Monad in Haskell, but that is just one implementation of one example of a monad.I’m not particularly sold on the Ur-importance of monads in programming, but I don’t get using such a specific implementation to deride the concept. Monads are an algebraic structure, application in programming languages is akin to using sum types to form enumerated data.', 'Given a monad M on a category C, it is among other things a functor from C to C, which means that we have functions from Hom(c, d) to Hom(M(c), M(d)) for each pair of objects c and d in C. [Here, by Hom(x, y), I mean the set of morphisms from x to y in C.]If C is a so-called \"closed category\", not only is there an actual set Hom(x, y) of morphisms from x to y, but also, there is internal to C a corresponding object x → y.We say a monad is \"strong\" if there are morphisms from x → y to M(x) → M(y) [note that these are morphisms in C between objects of C] which suitably correspond to the aforementioned functions from Hom(x, y) to Hom(M(x), M(y)) [note that these are morphisms in Set between objects of Set].This is the distinction between having an operator external to your programming language that rewrites functions from x to y into functions from M(x) to M(y) (plain monad) vs furthermore having this operator itself represented internal to your programming language by a function from x → y to M(x) → M(y) (strong monad).(This notion of strength really doesn\\'t have to do with monads specifically, and applies more generally to functors. It\\'s the same as what people call being an \"enriched functor\".)The notion of a strong monad on a closed category C goes beyond just the plain notion of a monad on C, because it asks for some structure to exist internal to C which otherwise only has to exist in Set. But if C itself is Set, this is automatic. This is why monads on Set are automatically strong.This is all muddied in the way people in Haskell world talk about monads and functors, because they never talk about monads on arbitrary categories, or functors between arbitrary categories. They never talk about categories at all because they only ever have one category in mind. They only ever talk about monads on Set, or functors from Set to Set [or rather, \"Set\" where \"sets\" are taken to be Haskell types and \"functions\" are taken to be Haskell functions. But this amounts to about the same thing, if you only ever work internal to \"Set\"]. This can make for some confusion in translating between how Haskell people use category-theoretic jargon and how category theorists use it.But there are more categories in the world beyond just the ambient category Set. For a simple example of a closed category and a non-strong monad on it, consider the four-element Boolean algebra with 0 < p, q < 1. We can construe this as a category, where there is a (unique) morphism from any value to any equal or larger value. This category is in fact cartesian closed; we have Boolean negation such that p and q are each other\\'s negations, and more generally, the interpretation of x → y becomes the material implication operation such that x → y = (NOT x) OR y.If we define on this the operation M which sends 0 to itself but sends all other values to 1, we find that this M is indeed functorial: Whenever x ≤ y, we have M(x) ≤ M(y). And this M is furthermore a monad: It\\'s easy to verify that x ≤ M(x) and M(M(x)) ≤ M(x) for all x. [All the other equations that go into being a monad are trivial in this partial order context where all parallel morphisms are equal]But this M is NOT a strong monad! Even though it\\'s true from our external perspective that x ≤ y entails M(x) ≤ M(y), that is not visible internal to this category, so to speak, in that we do not in general have that (x → y) ≤ M(x) → M(y). For example, p → 0 = q, but M(p) → M(0) = 0, and we do not have q ≤ 0.Another example along the same lines is where we take our category C to be Set^2, whose objects are pairs of sets and whose morphisms are pairs of functions, all composing component-wise, and equip it with a monad which sends (empty set, empty set) to itself and sends everything else to (one element set, one element set).There are also less trivial, more complicated examples, but this should perhaps get the idea across of what a non-strong monad. Of course, it requires thinking about categories in general to begin with.', \"In my own personal monad opinion, the 'strongest' idea of a monad to me is just a function or program.monad 1 | monad 2 | monad 3It doesn't have to be complicated.\", 'I think the article is an attempt to make your idea more precise. What if monad 3 could use the result of monad 1, not just monad 2? Then you couldn\\'t write that computation using your pipeline metaphor.The article is saying that by judicious use of a \"strength\" function, you can in fact write any monadic computation as such a pipeline (or composition of monadic functions).', 'If my example of pipeline is a limited metaphor, couldn\\'t it be expanded?I love this subject but it\\'s traditionally over-complex, so I appreciate the correction and explaination.How could \"strength\" be applied generically to programs outside of Haskell? Could the concept of pipelines be extended? Is programming too 1 dimensional? There must be ways to do this.', 'The whole point of the article is that the right-associativity of Haskell monads makes them not simple pipelines because it allows this:a -> b -> c\\n     \\\\_______^so c gets the results of both a and b \"for free\".', \"Whatright-associativity? The parentheses go like this:[1, 2] >>= \\\\x -> ([x, 10*x] >>= \\\\y -> [x*y])There is no associativity of >>=, any more than there's associativity of + in:12 + 34*(56 + 7*8)(Probably less, since + and * are distributive.)\", 'You\\'re right, there\\'s no right-associativity actually involved, but the article probably used the term because the code kinda looks right-associative if you squint. The point is that the rightmost >>= is evaluated first, which lets the y lambda capture x. The article put the parens like this:test3 = [1, 2] >>= (\\\\x -> [x, 10*x] >>= \\\\y -> [x*y])which to a non-Haskeller like me does make it look more right-associative than it actually is – and as the article showed, you can actually make it \"left-associative\" in the obvious way, which would indeed compile fine and be equivalent to the \"right-associative\" way if the y lambda didn\\'t refer to x.test3 = ([1, 2] >>= \\\\x -> [x, 10*x]) >>= \\\\y -> [x*y]', 'So how do you generalize this idea to programs and functions? My framing is \"incorrect\" I think but it feels far easier to reason about.Couldn\\'t this same idea be applied generically to all computer programs? Could its valuable situational properties ever be done in a way that is language neutral with arbitrary program monads?', 'The main reason that monads are restricted to fancy languages like Haskell is that the type system has to support their definition.There are some examples of attempted implementations the list monad in other languages on RosettaCodehttps://rosettacode.org/wiki/Monads/List_monadCaveat emptor, though. A lot of that page is erroneous.A few years ago I fixed up the definition for F#, which is perhaps the closest thing to a language for ordinary Joes in which true monadic style can be defined/achieved.', \"Monads are a concept in types and a specific theory but if you throw the rigid definition away can't they be done anywhere? For example, if I have three RaspberryPi's, isn't there a way I could compose them as monads?That is what I mean - it isn't a fair thing for me to say - but I feel like they would be so much more tangible if we could think about them as literal Things like this. Which is why my original example was composition of Programs instead of composition in a specific Programming Language.\", 'Each Raspberry Pi could perform a function that was notionally passed to the monadic bind operator, but really a monad is the rules under which the Raspberry Pis would be connected.From Wadler\\'s paper \"The Essence of Functional Programming\":\"2.1 What is a monad?For our purposes, a monad is a triple \\n(M,unitM,bindM) consisting of a type constructor M and a pair of polymorphic functions.unitM :: a-> M abindM :: M a-> (a-> M b)-> M bThese functions must satisfy three laws, which are discussed in Section 2.10.\"So the monad is a functor plus a few operations and laws.

I'm much happier now that I'm not meticulously collecting and worrying about backups and such. I have an ever growing MP3 collection which is mostly stuff from bandcamp (and other artist-friendly digital sellers) and some ripped CDs. But I don't back it up, and I won't transfer it to my next computer (though most of the digital purchases are re-downloadable, at least for now). I stopped completely with physical media after living in a few very small apartments, and since I no longer have a turntable or CD player (or a CD drive, for that matter).

I like how they show you music that was purchased by people who share some albums in their collection with you.I tried streaming for a few weeks.

Anyone, expert or not, in 1950, 1960, or even 1970 who was told that before the turn of the century a computer would defeat the world chess champion would conclude that said feat must have come as part of a breakthrough in AGI.

And so you had to be in big tech or a highly specialized shop to play.Now all you need is an API key and one line of code to call the most powerful models in the world.', \"I agree, but it's worth mentioning explicitly that the main driver of accessibility has been generalizability. The fact that LLMs are so effective at zero-shot and few-shot learning tasks is what made out-of-the-box API access practical for a wide range of use cases.

So, it's already useful but in a limited way and it remains to be seen how much better it's likely to get in the near future.But let's not confuse that in general with AI or Machine Learning which is already used heavily in lots of places.the specific type of architecture that gpt-4 uses for next word prediction is not the only possible architecture and is not what's used for many real world tasks.

The question is what is the degree to which  it’s possible to reduce the frequency and severity of hallucinations. If that degree is limited without major changes in architecture or major new breakthroughs, then usefulness of gpt-4 style models will be limited.  And we just don’t know the answer yet. So far, usefulness of gpt-4 is real but extremely limited.  Another issue is this approach means models are costly to train and don’t easily incorporate latest info about the world.  In short, it’s way too early to hype this up.', 'I think this view, that present day AI is something absolutely new, is actually the dominant view.I don\\'t believe the \"absolutely new\" view is very enlightening very often.

I guess fueled by a mix of jealousy and alcohol he confessed to drinking, the former ended up challenging his rival to a duel right then and there and getting beaten and left for dead. I think he never made it to the pole and ended up dying in an accident before it even happened.But the spirit of their rivalry and the lengths they went to one-up each other is so much like this Cook-Peary saga.The passion, the pride, the need for validation – it was all there.

However, the most SM active person I know also has lupus so it checks out /sI tend to think being idle is what drives most SM usage. Inflammation just happens to drive idle time because of pain being the alternative.', 'n=1 anecdotal reflection here. I\\'ve had have chronic low grade inflammation from two different disorders for a very long time, including a GI disorder that definitely triggers my liver to work overtime (experienced in the form of general soreness, occasional stabs of pain in liver area and indications of impaired bile production and/or bile acid malabsorption, or BAM, during my longer flare-ups). So CRP is probably on the menu for me on a frequent basis.The inflammatory aspect makes me feel like a complete zombie after several days of flaring up. I highly doubt this is a unique subjective experience. In fact, if you do some googling, you will find that chronic low-grade inflammation (as well as disruptions of the GI tract / microbiome) are quite strongly linked to treatment resistant depression, which is another thing I happen to have. I haven\\'t personally read studies investigating it, but I suspect \"brain fog\" and attention/memory issues are also strongly correlated with chronic inflammation, even of the \\'low grade\\' variety.When I get into these states, brought on by flare-ups, my mind wants nothing more than to zone out in such a way as to increase the perceived speed with which time passes. Because time is basically the only thing that can get me out of a bad flare-up (as long as I avoid a huge list of foods and activities and strictly follow certain protocols as well). If I could sleep through all of it that would be ideal (a common refrain among the chronically depressed). And at the same time, stress and complicated situations increase the chances that I do something wrong that is likely to extend the flare-up (which to me suggests an adaptive role of depression during chronic health problems).Even watching movies and TV feel too effortful at times: you have to focus on a storyline, remember what characters said and did, and maintain some emotional connection to the story in order to be engaged and thus have time pass quickly... all which takes effort. Social media truly is the high fructose corn syrup + hydrogenated palm oil of passive time-wasting activities. Getting into \"the zone\" in terms of mindlessly clicking as minutes and hours pass by in a flash takes almost zero effort once you are accustomed (read: addicted) to it.

This inflammationleads to increased permeability of the BBB,*allowing for easier entry of inflammatory molecules or immune cells into the CNS.If you happen to have a disruption/disorder of your microbiome that includes loosening of the tight junctions of your epithelium (aka intestinal permeability aka \"leaky gut\"), that means that cytotoxic byproducts of bacterial metabolism and your body\\'s immune responses to their presence (eg Mast cell release of histamine, heparin, cytokines, chemokines, etc) can enter your bloodstream and then cross your BBB to get into your brain.I believe that inflammation plays a role in each of these three steps: loosening of the tight junctions in epithelium, release of chemical mediators by mast cells (eg in response to detection of cytokines, rather than strictly in the presence of allergens and toxins), and increasing the permeability of the blood brain barrier.The chemokines are particularly concerning:https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11786310/>Chemokines in the brain have been recognised as essential elements in neurodegenerative diseases and related neuroinflammation.Fun times!', 'Or is it aproxy?Suppose X causes inflammation and social media use.Suppose you want to reduce social media use.You look at this study and think I should reduce inflammation, so I can reduce social media use?

I hope the UIs improve to make this as transparent as possible.Just thinking about how to productize this flow, it should be quite easy to implement the \"thumbs up/down\" feedback option on every image generated in the UI, plus an optional text label to override \"wrong\". Then when you have enough HF (or nightly) you could have a batch job to re-train a new LoRA with your updated preferences.In principle you could collect HF from the implicit tree-traversal that happens when you generate N candidate images from a prompt and then pick one to refine. Or more explicitly, have a quick UI to rank/score a batch, or a trash bin in the digital workspace to discard images you don\\'t like at each iteration of refinement (batching that negative feedback to update your project/global LoRA later).Going further I wonder what the fastest possible iteration loop for feedback would be? For images in particular you should be able to wire up a very short feedback loop with keypresses in response to image generation. What happens if you strap yourself to that rig for a few hours and collect ~10k preferences at 1/s?

One of the early demos (not currently live, but I plan on bringing it back soon) was precisely the type of flow you're talking about, although we used 'prompt refinement' as a cheap proxy for tuning the actual model weights.Roughly, we aim to build out core python-level infra that makes it easy to write flows in mostly native python and then allows you track executions of your generative flows, including executions of 'human components' such as raters. We also support time travel / rewind / replay, automatic gradio UIs, fastAPI (the latter two very experimental atm).Medium term we want to make it easy to take any generative flow, wrap it in a 'human rating' flow, auto-deploy as an API or gradio UI and then fit using a number of techniques, e.g., RLHF, finetuning, A/B testing of generative subcomponents, etc, so stay tuned.At the moment, we're focused on getting the 'bones' right, but between the quickstart (https://github.com/agentic-ai/enact/blob/main/examples/quick...) and our readme (https://github.com/agentic-ai/enact/tree/main#why-enact) you get a decent idea of where we're headed.We're looking for people to kick the tires / contribute, so if this sounds interesting, please check it out.\", '> I didn\\'t spot in the article, how many `wrong` images were there?

It\\'s running the exact same code otherwise to randomly generate prompts.The image caption is a simplified version of the prompt. e.g., \"Snowcapped mountain peaks with an oxbow lake at golden hour.\"Behind the scenes, a whole bunch of extra descriptive stuff is added, so the prompt that SD v1.5 / SDXL get is: \"beautiful painting of snowcapped mountain peaks with an oxbow lake at golden hour, concept art, trending on artstation, 8k, very sharp, extremely detailed, volumetric, beautiful lighting, serene, oil painting, wet-on-wet brush strokes, bob ross style\"Anyway, I feel like the quality of SDXL is sharper and it just nails subjects a lot better. It also tries to add reflections and shadows (not always correctly), whereas that didn\\'t happen as much with SD v1.5.I\\'m pretty impressed! Especially because Stability.ai had released an update model of Stable Diffusion before SDXL: SD v2.0 and SD v2.1. The results (IMHO) were absolute garbage using the same prompts.[1]https://twitter.com/mrrossbot[2]https://botsin.space/@MrRossBot', 'From my experiments it seems that SD XL understands prompts much better. While SD 1.5 is great at generating your typical \"anime girl with big boobs\" stuff - if you try to generate something a little bit more unusual - it usually doesn\\'t generate exactly what you want and seems to straight up ignore large parts of the prompt.SD XL seems to understand weird and unusual prompts a lot better.SD XL is capable of generating 1024x1024 images without hacks like \"hires fix\". That\\'s a very good thing, because hires fix sometimes introduces additional glitches while upscaling. Especially at higher denoising strength. \\nHires fix fixed the broken face - yay, but the subject now has 3 legs instead of two. Things like that happen far less often with SD XL.', \"Yes, currently SDXL doesn't really beat the best SD1.5 checkpoints quality-wise. But it (and the currently available checkpoints) shows awesome promise, so give it a six months or so.\", \"Please consider posting the LoRa on civitai.com as well as the stable diffusion Reddit.These results look pretty good, looking forward to trying it out. I hadn't realized that the generative images buzz was dying out, since I'm using it regularly I guess it is always in buzz for me.\", 'I posted the original release to /r/StableDiffusion but all the comments are \"why not compatable with A1111?\" and I can\\'t find a good script to do the conversion:https://www.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/15r5k3i/i_...Civitai has syndicated the LoRA:https://civitai.com/models/128708/sdxl-wrong-lora', 'You will get more users if you provide a safetensors file instead of bin and pickletensors a lot of people have gotten really scared by the malware scare that was going through social media a few months ago.', 'Thank you for note on this.  I had not heard there were already trojan horse malware being slipped into tensor files as python scripts.  Apparently torch pickle uses eval on the tensor file with no filter.Heard surprisingly little commentary on this topic.  The full explanation of how Safetensors are \"Safe\" can be found from the developer at:https://github.com/huggingface/safetensors/discussions/111', \"And for a good reason. A big hunk of floating-point numbers really shouldn't be able to execute arbitrary code. Or any code at all.\", \"Agreed I feel like, and I do this a lot as well, people have a tendency to track their habits and assume everyone follows that.  From my perspective, the gen image buzz is still as hot as ever!If I lacked excitement for SDXL it was because it felt like the there was no massive jump in image quality to me.  Sure the size doubling is great, but it also presents a problem, as I don't always want to generate 1024x1024 images. I still use third party trained 1.5 models because they create damned good outputs and I have like 5 different upscaling solutions and at least one will add new detail as things are upscaled.\", 'SDXL is more resolution-agnostic than SD1x, 768x768 works fine, but admittedly going down to 512x512 does tend to produce cropped images.', \"Very cool. Will give this idea a spin soon. I'm a bit of a scientist myself too :)Here's something interesting I did few days ago.- Generated images using mixture of different styles of prompts with SDXL Base Model ( using Diffusers )- Trained a LoRA with them- Generated again with this LoRA + Prompts used to generate the training set.Ended up with results with enhanced effects - glitchier, weirder, high def.Results =>https://imgur.com/gallery/vUobKPKI’m gonna train another LoRA with these generations and repeat the process obviously!This is a pretty neat way to bypass the 77 token limit in Diffusers and develop tons of more styles now that I think about it.You can play around with the LoRA athttps://replicate.com/galleri5/nammeh( GitHub account needed )Will publish it to CivitAI soon.\", 'Tangentially related: for reasons I don\\'t yet really understand, the LORAs that I build for Stable Diffusion XL only work well if I give a pretty generic negative prompt.These are fine-tuned on 6 photos of my face, and if I use them with positive prompts, the generated characters don\\'t look much like me. But if I add generic negative terms like \"low quality\", suddenly the depiction of my face is almost exactly right.I\\'ve trained several models and this has been true across a range of learning rates and number of training epochs.To me, this feels like it will somehow ultimately be connected to whatever is driving minimaxir\\'s observations in this post.', \"This is really interesting. Like mentioned in the article, this is a kind of RLHF, and that's what takes GPT3 from a difficult to use LLM to a chat bot which is able to confuse some people into thinking is has consciousness. It makes it much more usable.I don't know how these models are trained, but hopefully future models will include bad results as negative training data, baking it into the base model.It's only mentioned in passing in the article, but apparently it's possible to merge LoRAs? How would you do that, I'd like to use one LoRA to include my own subjects, this LoRA to make the results better, and maybe a third one for a particular style.\", \"Merging LoRAs is essentially taking a weighted average of the LoRA adapter weights.
