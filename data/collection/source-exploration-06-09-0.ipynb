      "It takes a moment for the Japanese superhero adventure “Shin Kamen Rider” to find a rhythm and stick to it. Writer/director Hideaki Anno (“Neon Genesis Evangelion”) throws a lot at viewers during the movie’s preliminary half hour or so, but it all reflects the optimistic character of motorcyclist hero Takeshi Hongo (Sosuke Ikematsu), who transforms into the grasshopper-themed robot biker Kamen Rider. There’s also the movie’s poorly-rendered special effects, glassy-looking handheld photography, hard cuts, and off-kilter camera blocking. Most of these choices are deliberate, just like in both “Shin Godzilla” and “Shin Ultraman,” which Anno co-created with director/co-writer/special-effects supervisor Shinji Higuchi. “Shin Kamen Rider” looks like the cheapest (to make) of the three movies, so this much unusual style might initially seem more like a bug than a feature. Eventually, this outstanding reboot’s most generic elements appear subordinate to the title character’s deranged, boyish, and sometimes romantic subjective reality.   \n",

      "Anno’s take on Kamen Rider plays out like a loving, idiosyncratic deconstruction of Kamen Rider, a wayward young hero who defends the world from the villainous SHOCKER organization and their various animal-men cyborgs. In “Shin Kamen Rider,” Hongo sets out on his anti-SHOCKER crusade after he reluctantly (and gruesomely) beats up a group of beret-clad SHOCKER heavies and a spider-robot (Nao Omori), too.    Hongo is then debriefed by icy monster-hunter Ruriko (Minami Hamabe) and her dad, Dr. Midorikawa (“Tetsuo: The Iron Man” director Shinya Tsukamoto), a disenchanted robot-building scientist. Basically, Dr. Midorikawa used to make insect-men for SHOCKER, but then turned against them, and also experimented on Hongo to give him the super-powers needed to defeat SHOCKER. Dr. Midorikawa dies pretty early on; he’s the first of a few characters who, when they croak, dissolves into a man-shaped silhouette of seafoam bubbles. After he melts away into nothingness, Ruriko and Hongo set out on their journey to destroy SHOCKER, with some help from a pair of mysterious government agents, Taki and Tachibana (Takumi Saitoh and Yutaka Takenouchi).    A good part of “Shin Kamen Rider” concerns Hongo’s struggle to serve others without betraying his conscience. He struggles with his computer-programmed survival instincts, which tend to be brutal. But each new insect-themed adversary re-orients both Ruriko and Hongo’s relationship to their shared mission so that it’s a more personal fight: the final boss antagonist is ultimately Ruriko’s megalomaniacal brother Ichiro (Mirai Moriyama), a butterfly-monster and the leader of SHOCKER.    Anno also frustrates and re-orients the viewers’ relationship with what were always childishly simple characters. He periodically shoves his camera into actors’ faces or beneath their legs, cuts just ahead of the action, and blows up several key images so that any featured actor’s face is more prominent than their characters’ bright and garish outfits. This potentially off-putting style still effectively dramatizes Hongo and his allies’ adrenaline-fueled disorientation. Anno also catches viewers up as we go, slowing down the action and the dramatic momentum just enough to make even a fight with a half-praying-mantis, half-chameleon monster (Kanata Hongo) seem affecting.    Some viewers might be distracted by the movie’s stop-and-go pacing, unsophisticated action choreography, and unglamorous, low-resolution special effects. Maybe, but so what? Anno’s take resonates because it shares the experimental spirit and naïve angst—Who am I, and how do I hold onto myself in a group united by a common goal?—both prior “Shin” reboots and both Anno’s original “Neon Genesis Evangelion” series and its recent “Rebuild” remakes of that oft-copied anime. Many people will come to “Shin Kamen Rider” expecting a movie by Hideaki Anno; they won’t be disappointed.   \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Action fans will have to make like Hongo and re-orient how they see a buggy bike-riding superhero whose main power source remains a pinwheel-activated belt buckle. Thankfully, Anno’s deep love and understanding for the Kamen Rider characters never devolves into Xerox-faithful reverence. The concluding half hour or so of “Shin Kamen Rider” also pulls everything together in such a smooth and impressive way that it miraculously recasts the movie’s bumpy opening in a softer light. Even the action scenes appreciate as extensions of Anno and his characters’ quest to re-imagine their roles as action heroes in a heavily automated world.    Anno’s fingerprints stand out, given how mindlessly literal and/or timid many contemporary American superhero movies tend to be. “Shin Kamen Rider” remains thrilling and thoughtful, both as an expression of Anno’s instantly recognizable style and a weirdly moving expression of the title hero’s restless spirit. You might not believe that you could be so moved by a superhero movie about a grasshopper-man on a bike. You would be wrong.  Now playing in theaters. \n",

       "  'review_text': \"Jean (Rosy McEwen) is dying her hair blonde on a quiet night in. The only noise is the sound of a dating show on her television. Her eyes are blue, but soon we notice that so much of the world around her is also blue. Her bathroom is a pretty pale blue, and so is her jacket, the P.E. uniform at the school where she teaches—which also has blue walls. Her car is a darker shade of blue, and the lights of her favorite club are mostly blue. The palette gives the movie its title but beyond its creative premise,Georgia Oakley’s “Blue Jean” uses its melodic visual aesthetic as part of the story. It immerses\\xa0the viewer in the cold, isolated feelings of Jean’s repressed existence in late 1980s England whenMargaret Thatcherwas about to sign legislation to ostracize the gay and lesbian community. Jean's neighbors and family give her funny looks, and she has to suffocatingly hide who she is from her coworkers. With her feature debut, director Oakley uses an incredible amount of detail in bringing to life the characters she’s written and the painstaking efforts to color code her sets, costumes, and lighting to get just the right emotional tone and shades of '80s pastels. Her style is reminiscent of another British filmmaker,Joanna Hogg, who also takes great pains crafting gorgeous compositions for her frame. Other than blue, from blue grays to saturated deep blues, the color that makes the second most notable appearance is pink, as if emphasizing the rigid gender expectations society, her co-workers, and relatives have for Jean. Her much more feminine coworker and sister wear shades of pink with ease, but Jean is off in her blue world and its blue hues. The two colors contrast, yet Victor Seguin’s cinematography incorporates them flawlessly into a dreamlike vision shot on 16mm. Jean’s story may be heartbreaking, but Oakley and her crew’s technical work is awe-inspiring.What little breathing room Jean enjoys outside her home extends only to queer safe spaces like the lesbian bar where she shoots pool and drinks with friends or her girlfriend’s home with other lesbian roommates. Even then, Jean still doesn’t look fully comfortable switching from passing straight at work to being herself, occasionally looking around as if afraid to be caught. She panics over her girlfriend, Viv (Kerrie Hayes), and her much more out and proud behavior. Jean worries she’ll lose her job at the school if they find out she’s a lesbian, and the feeling only intensifies when a new lesbian student arrives and starts visiting Jean’s favorite nightspot. Jean’s efforts to push the young girl back into conformity backfire, forcing her to reckon with hiding her identity.McEwen brings Jean’s complex inner conflict to life with every measured stare and carefully guarded pose. Her body language is as tense as a trip wire, set to snap at any second, which is radically different from the energy Hayes gives Viv, an unapologetically tattooed and head-shaved punk ready to return dirty stares with a flirtatious one. She’s not one to be intimidated, but Jean sadly lives in a perpetual state of caution, bringing problems to their relationship.“Blue Jean” may be a period piece, but it’s timely as LGBTQ rights regress in both the U.K. and the U.S., with the rhetoric of “save the children” once again weaponized against the queer community. Jean’s central struggle to come out or continue hiding to save her job is a problem she agonizes over throughout the movie, turning down invites to go to the pub with coworkers and guarding herself against being associated with other lesbians. Jean quickly retreats when a bully torments new student Lois (Lucy Halliday) or when Viv calls her at work. “I know it seems unfair, but I’m trying to help you,” Jean insists when coaching Lois to avoid doing anything that may draw attention. Through their shared experiences, the movie’s scope widens, showing the difficulty of living as a queer person when homophobia is internalized, in person, on the news, and practically in the air. At one point, Viv angrily confronts Jean about her efforts to kick Lois out of the lesbian bar, “How is that girl going to know she has a place in this world?” And sadly, it seems as if more and more people today are forced to ask a similar question. Oakley’s care and McEwen’s intense performance make “Blue Jean” one of this year’s most impressive movies. It deals with so much heartbreak without as many words; its pain is communicated through its somberly beautiful palette and performances. In addition to Soraya Gilanni's production design and Kirsty Halliday's costumes, the film’s soundtrack immerses the audience in the era's music, with songs that range from new wave tracks like New Order’s “Blue Monday” and Pink Rhythm’s “Melodies of Love” to the disco-tinged delights of Jimmy Ross’ “First True Love Affair (Larry Levan Remix)” and the punk beat of The Larks U.K.’s “Maggie Maggie Maggie Out Out Out.” But as Jean argues with her sister about holding onto her old wedding photo and shrinks behind her coworkers bad-mouthing gays and lesbians like her, the focus returns to her face, carefully obscuring her outrage, and tallies the day-to-day indignities she endures to fight for a place in a society that still rejects her. She’s powerless to change the world around her, but as we watch Jean find her strength, we see what’s possible when we make the world more accepting of ourselves and others.Now playing in theaters.\",\n",

       "  'review_text': 'With “Air,” “Tetris,” and “BlackBerry,” the last few months have borne both spring flowers and corporate biographies that mythologize well-known products and brands. Their narrative arcs follow a relatively familiar pattern: under-appreciated visionaries and everyday workers unite to face setbacks and product deadlines to go on to revolutionize their respective industries. The stories may not always end happily ever after, but this “How I Built This” kind of movie is inspirational catnip, like a working man’s version of a Horatio Alger story. Earlier models of the format, likeJohn LeeHancock\\'s \"The Founder\" and David O. Russell\\'s \"Joy,\" were just hints at a growing interest in the lives of those behind well-known products and corporations, which seems to have grown in the ensuing years of inflation and economic insecurity—not too dissimilar to the current spate of movies set in the ‘80s and ‘90s, which also had their stretches of economic bumps. Maybe these movies are a little boost for bootstrapping morale: that all anyone needs to succeed is a little conviction and the right partners. At a time when white-collar workers are resisting the call to return to offices or some companies have done away with physical office spaces altogether, these period pieces can feel like they’re romanticizing (or cautioning against) what’s been lost—both the good (camaraderie, getting to know your coworkers outside of a Zoom box) and the bad (managerial abuse, white collar crime, no work-life balance, etc.).Then there’sEva Longoria’s narrative directorial debut, “Flamin’ Hot,” which, on a level of seriousness between a potential award hopeful like “Air” and the irreverent but biting “BlackBerry,” occupies its own too-silly-to-be-taken-seriously spot. “Flamin\\' Hot” follows sometimes unreliable narrator and main characterRichard Montañez(Jesse Garcia) from a rough, impoverished childhood, a mistake-filled adolescence, to an adulthood with some regrets. In the 1980s, he’s a desperate man looking for a second chance to provide for his family. He catches a break with the help of his adoring wife, Judy (Annie Gonzalez), and lands a job on the janitorial staff of a Frito-Lay plant in Rancho Cucamonga. Not only does Richard work hard, but he also pays close attention to the machines. Over time, he\\xa0learns how they work with the help of a reluctant mentor, Clarence C. Baker (Dennis Haysbert). Richard’s hard work and tenacity lead him to invent a new spicy blend of snacks based on the flavors of his childhood. He then jumps the corporate ladder to pitch it to Frito Lay’s parent company president, Roger Enrico (Tony Shalhoub), and the rest is his tasty history.Although “Flamin’ Hot” might be a finger-licking good story, it’salso not true. And now,\\xa0I have to wrestle with its artificially sweet, feel-good inspirational story. What is the movie\\'s purpose if Frito-Lay told the filmmakers their source material was false? Was the janitor rags-to-riches story just too hot to drop? Do we,as a woefully underrepresented group in movies, need this story, facts be damned? As a Latina critic who has been writing about my community’s stories for as long as I’ve had a career, I want better for us and our storytellers. While I enjoy some aspects of this movie, I’m not sure the means justified the lackluster result. The other corporate films I mentioned above have\\xa0their fair share of fabricated conversations and different sequences of real-life events, but “Flamin’ Hot” isn’t interested in accuracy beyond vintage Frito-Lay logos. Instead, Longoria\\'s film becomes an extended lesson in tying a product to cultural identity, targeting an audience, and how to monetize them as prospective consumers. It’s just business, baby, and sometimes the characters in the middle get lost in the capitalist shuffle. Then again, Montañez’s self-mythologizing is his business, and this movie is now an extension of those efforts to rewrite history—a product placement, if you will—cinematically solidifying his alleged role in a product he didn’t create.My ethical qualms aside, Longoria channels the hard-working Mexican American/Latino/immigrant ethos in her film, showing genuine love and respect for the hustle that keeps food on the table and the lights on despite impossible odds. In her version of the events, Richard earns redemption from his youthful mistakes by focusing on what’s best for his family and taking the extra initiative for an idea he believes will save his job and the company. Although this is supposed to be Richard’s success story, his scenes with Judy are the movie\\'s real highlights and give a ridiculous film some sturdy emotional grounding. Garcia’s bombastic performance was likely evened out by Gonzalez’s strong presence, even if selfishly, I wished she were in more scenes. Together, they shore up some goodwill to cover some of the film’s shaggier flaws. The longer\\xa0they spend apart, the more the movie feels like it\\'s losing momentum until Shalhoub, as the corporate-Mr. Rogers-like Enrico, livens things up again.Before the film begins with a line about calling Latinos “spicy,” it opens with a Mexican musical spin on the Searchlight theme, echoing Disney’s mariachi take on their opening theme when Pixar’s “Coco” hit theaters. This choice sets a celebratory tone, but it feels off. Where “Coco” was a celebration of a traditional holiday, “Flamin’ Hot” feels like it\\'s selling me something, be it Montañez’s story or its can-do message. Writers Linda Yvette Chávez andLewis Colickcan\\'t quite find a balance between the relatable human drama and low-brow jokes—like extended sequences of mostly white men in boardroom meetings talking like fighting cholos, as voiced by Richard—or cliched moments like a sports movie-like rally to fire up the plant to sell Flamin’ Hot products. Overall, “Flamin’ Hot” is more cheesy than spicy. Its focus on the “Si, se puede ... trabajar y ganar dinero” mantra dulls the flavors of what makes the movie enjoyable: the family at the center of Richard’s drive to survive. Even then, I still struggle with the lingering aftertaste of its half-true/not-at-all-true fable about the American success story. What does it say when we lionize a person who says they did something they didn’t and hold them up as a pillar of our community, who, if anything, perfected selling our connections to our culture back to ourselves as a form of identity consumerism? Near the end ofJohn Ford’s “The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance,” one character throws out the truth and says,\"When the legend becomes fact, print the legend.\"If nothing else, “Flamin’ Hot” does that best.Now playing on Hulu.',\n",

       "  'review_text': 'It’s still a movie about giant space robots talking trash and smashing into each other, but “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts” is better than most offerings in the franchise.This latest summertime extravaganza, based on the Hasbro toys, doesn’t reach the heights of the unexpectedly delightful “Bumblebee” from 2018. But it’s far superior to the five cacophonous blockbustersMichael Baydirected between 2007 and 2017. Steven Caple Jr. (“Creed II”) takes over the reins this time, bringing a narrative focus and visual coherence that’s been woefully lacking in the past. You can actually see what’s happening in the gargantuan action sequences, which is always a plus. Longtime fans will probably revel in the childhood nostalgia of seeing these beloved characters come to life once again. Besides the Autobots—led as always by Optimus Prime and voiced byPeter Cullenwith his signature gravitas—“Rise of the Beasts” also features Maximals from the “Transformers: Beast Wars” TV series and various intergalactic villains doing the bidding of the planet-gobbling Unicron (Colman Domingo). They’re all in pursuit of the same ancient, McGuffiny doohickey which is super powerful and can cause massive damage.But what makes “Rise of the Beasts” palatable for everyone else is the fact that it demonstrates surprising care with the human beings trapped in the midst of this epic battle between good and evil. That’s a rarity in this series, known more for the bland types and groan-inducing banter of the Bay movies. The screenplay, credited to five people, gives the likableAnthony RamosandDominique Fishbackthe opportunity to create characters we might even care about.And yes, it does sound inherently contradictory to say: “I would like more humanity in my movie about otherworldly beings pretending to be cars and trucks.” But that’s what makes “Rise of the Beasts,” andTravis Knight’s ‘80s-set “Bumblebee” stand out.This isn’t exactly a sequel to “Bumblebee,” but it does begin soon afterward in 1994 and before the events of the first “Transformers.” So it’s sort of a prequel and sort of a reboot. Whatever it is, it takes place in a grungy, pre-Giuliani New York City where Ramos’ Noah Diaz is a former military electronics expert looking for work to support his family. This includes his adorable younger brother, Kris (Dean Scott Vazquez), who’s suffering from a chronic illness. At the same time, at a museum on Ellis Island, Fishback’s Elena is fighting to prove herself as an artifacts expert who’s knowledgeable beyond her years. These are both young people of color being repeatedly underestimated and marginalized by the predominately white people in charge, which provides more context and social criticism than we usually see in these movies. They both find themselves flung into the hunt for the all-important Transwarp Key—Noah when he tries to steal a Porsche that turns out to be an Autobot, Elena when she studies a new sculpture that’s come into the lab with mysterious symbols on it. One of the most enjoyable parts of “Rise of the Beasts” is the back-and-forth between Ramos andPete Davidsonas the voice of Mirage, the wisecracking sports car. The role calls for Davidson to showcase his irreverent, playful persona. It’s perfect casting, and it may be his best work ever.Other heavy hitters among the voice cast includeMichelle Yeohas the majestic Maximal falcon Airazor,Ron Perlmanas the roaring gorilla Optimus Primal, andPeter Dinklageas the vicious Scourge, the leader of the Terrorcons who’s Unicron’s right-hand man. The ever-charmingCristo Fernándezbasically does his sunny Dani Rojas personality from “Ted Lasso” as a 1970s Volkswagen bus named Wheeljack, but it’s still a pleasure. Nineties hip-hop classics from A Tribe Called Quest, Wu-Tang Clan, Diggable Planets, The Notorious B.I.G. and more are a great fit and provide an infectious vibe.But ultimately, “Rise of the Beasts” does what every Transformers movie has to do: wrap up with a seemingly endless fight sequence in which big, shiny chunks of metal slam noisily into each other. The smaller and more intimate special effects are more impressive than these massive set pieces; Mirage evolves in a multitude of cool ways that look tactile and realistic, for example. But while this climax isn’t as dizzying and interminable as they so often are, it’s still rather dull compared to the action that came before it.There is also the fundamental problem that there are no real stakes: We know what happens to these characters, and that they’ll not only be OK but also survive for several more movies. And of course, a mid-credits scene suggests that there’s even more to come from this cinematic universe, because there’s always more to come. So you may as well buckle up.Opens Friday, June 9th.',\n",

       "  'review_text': 'A group of lifelong friends gathers together at a friend\\'s brownstone apartment, all battle-scarred from their experiences in the recently-ended Second World War (as the title \"Brooklyn 45\" makes clear). They have all done things in wartime they are not proud of, and they all suffer emotional/physical trauma. They have been summoned by their friend Clive (Larry Fessenden), whose wife died by suicide just a month before. After the catching-up chit-chat, he springs a request: He would like to host a séance to make contact with his dead wife. He\\'s been reading up on the occult, and\\xa0believes in the scientific veracity of the sources. His friends, practical military people, are resistant and skeptical, but he insists: they must help him. They must! This is the premise ofTed Geoghegan’s latest movie. \"Brooklyn 45\" takes place entirely on one set, the front room of the brownstone, and it unfolds in real time like a play. Billed as a supernatural horror film, \"Brooklyn 45,\" which Geoghegan also wrote, is more than a strict genre label would suggest. Ghosts and spirits appear, and weird things are indeed summoned, but \"Brooklyn 45\" is really a meditation on grief and the unfinished business of war as experienced by a group who struggle with adjusting to peacetime. After facing the horrors of Nazi-occupied Europe, how are they supposed to just go back to normal life? After four years of viewing all Germans as Nazis, it\\'s hard to just turn that off.Marla (Anne Ramsay), injured by a bomb explosion, was one of the military\\'s most feared and respected Nazi interrogators. She just married Bob (Ron E. Rains), a meek-and-mild man sneered at by the rest of the men for his lack of combat experience. Archie (Jeremy Holm) is an intimidating tree trunk of a man, a war hero whose reputation is tarnished by accusations of a terrible and unforgivable war crime. There will be a trial. The ends don\\'t justify the means, after all. Archie is gay, and openly so, tolerating the ribbing he gets about it from his friend Paul (Ezra Buzzington), an upright military commander, still in uniform, and still suspicious of all \"Krauts.\" Nazis lurk in every corner, and Paul has suspicions about the German-American woman who runs a grocery store down the street (Kristina Klebe). Apparently, Clive\\'s dead wife shared Paul\\'s paranoia and spent her final days obsessed with Nazi spies hiding out in America, hiding out on her block.Geoghegan and his ensemble cast dig into all this thorny complexity instead of running away from it or ironing it out into a black-and-white binary. Each character is wracked by moral ambiguity and ethical compromise to some degree. Marla is now a happy wife, yet the ghost of her interrogator self—she freely used torture—hovers around her. Archie maintains his upright hero persona, but his reputation has taken a hit. He\\'s ashamed of himself and can\\'t admit it. During the war, Paul\\'s constant rage had a socially acceptable space to express itself. Now, without an enemy, he is lost. And Clive is a wreck. Larry Fessenden has been doing excellent, nuanced work for years (I loved him in the recent \"Jakob\\'s Wife\"), and his torment in \"Brooklyn 45\" is almost difficult to watch. Drowning in alcohol, ravaged by grief, he is the center around which the rest swirl with worry, irritation, and terror at what his séance has unleashed. The script could use some trimming. The run-time is a bit bloated, and it takes a while to get things going. But this isn\\'t 100% a negative (it gives you time to get to know the characters). The friendship bond is palpable. You feel the affection and closeness. This is crucial in establishing the story\\'s emotional structure. \"Brooklyn 45\" is a ghost story, yes, but the ghost isn\\'t just Clive\\'s dead wife summoned from the beyond. It\\'s the ghost of innocence, of ideals, of certainty, the ghost of who they were before the war as opposed to who they are now. With no enemy left to fight, they\\'re all lost.\"Hitler\\'s dead. You\\'re fighting a pile of ashes!\" one of them exclaims.How to live with this knowledge is easy for some, impossible for others. What we\\'re seeing, ultimately, is combat trauma managed by alcohol and denial. \"Brooklyn 45\" has its scare shocks and jolts of terror, its confrontation with unexplainable phenomena, but its interest lies in the psychological and emotional, and Geoghegan has created a space where all of it can be looked at, or run from, acknowledged or denied. The pile of ashes is a mile high.On Shudder now.',\n",

       "  'review_text': 'It takes a moment for the Japanese superhero adventure “Shin Kamen Rider” to find a rhythm and stick to it. Writer/directorHideaki Anno(“Neon Genesis Evangelion”) throws a lot at viewers during the movie’s preliminary half hour or so, but it all reflects the optimistic character of motorcyclist hero Takeshi Hongo (Sosuke Ikematsu), who transforms into the grasshopper-themed robot biker Kamen Rider.There’s also the movie’s poorly-rendered special effects, glassy-looking handheld photography, hard cuts, and off-kilter camera blocking. Most of these choices are deliberate, just like in both “Shin Godzilla” and “Shin Ultraman,” which Anno co-created with director/co-writer/special-effects supervisorShinji Higuchi. “Shin Kamen Rider” looks like the cheapest (to make) of the three movies, so this much unusual style might initially seem more like a bug than a feature. Eventually, this outstanding reboot’s most generic elements appear subordinate to the title character’s deranged, boyish, and sometimes romantic subjective reality. Anno’s take on Kamen Rider plays out like a loving, idiosyncratic deconstruction of Kamen Rider, a wayward young hero who defends the world from the villainous SHOCKER organization and their various animal-men cyborgs. In “Shin Kamen Rider,” Hongo sets out on his anti-SHOCKER crusade after he reluctantly (and gruesomely) beats up a group of beret-clad SHOCKER heavies and a spider-robot (Nao Omori), too.Hongo is then debriefed by icy monster-hunter Ruriko (Minami Hamabe) and her dad, Dr. Midorikawa (“Tetsuo: The Iron Man” directorShinya Tsukamoto), a disenchanted robot-building scientist. Basically, Dr. Midorikawa used to make insect-men for SHOCKER, but then turned against them, and also experimented on Hongo to give him the super-powers needed to defeat SHOCKER. Dr. Midorikawa dies pretty early on; he’s the first of a few characters who, when they croak, dissolves into a man-shaped silhouette of seafoam bubbles. After he melts away into nothingness, Ruriko and Hongo set out on their journey to destroy SHOCKER, with some help from a pair of mysterious government agents, Taki and Tachibana (Takumi SaitohandYutaka Takenouchi).A good part of “Shin Kamen Rider” concerns Hongo’s struggle to serve others without betraying his conscience. He struggles with his computer-programmed survival instincts, which tend to be brutal. But each new insect-themed adversary re-orients both Ruriko and Hongo’s relationship to their shared mission so that it’s a more personal fight: the final boss antagonist is ultimately Ruriko’s megalomaniacal brother Ichiro (Mirai Moriyama), a butterfly-monster and the leader of SHOCKER.Anno also frustrates and re-orients the viewers’ relationship with what were always childishly simple characters. He periodically shoves his camera into actors’ faces or beneath their legs, cuts just ahead of the action, and blows up several key images so that any featured actor’s face is more prominent than their characters’ bright and garish outfits. This potentially off-putting style still effectively dramatizes Hongo and his allies’ adrenaline-fueled disorientation. Anno also catches viewers up as we go, slowing down the action and the dramatic momentum just enough to make even a fight with a half-praying-mantis, half-chameleon monster (Kanata Hongo) seem affecting.Some viewers might be distracted by the movie’s stop-and-go pacing, unsophisticated action choreography, and unglamorous, low-resolution special effects. Maybe, but so what? Anno’s take resonates because it shares the experimental spirit and naïve angst—Who am I, and how do I hold onto myself in a group united by a common goal?—both prior “Shin” reboots and both Anno’s original “Neon Genesis Evangelion” series and its recent “Rebuild” remakes of that oft-copied anime. Many people will come to “Shin Kamen Rider” expecting a movie by Hideaki Anno; they won’t be disappointed. Action fans will have to make like Hongo and re-orient how they see a buggy bike-riding superhero whose main power source remains a pinwheel-activated belt buckle. Thankfully, Anno’s deep love and understanding for the Kamen Rider characters never devolves into Xerox-faithful reverence. The concluding half hour or so of “Shin Kamen Rider” also pulls everything together in such a smooth and impressive way that it miraculously recasts the movie’s bumpy opening in a softer light. Even the action scenes appreciate as extensions of Anno and his characters’ quest to re-imagine their roles as action heroes in a heavily automated world.Anno’s fingerprints stand out, given how mindlessly literal and/or timid many contemporary American superhero movies tend to be. “Shin Kamen Rider” remains thrilling and thoughtful, both as an expression of Anno’s instantly recognizable style and a weirdly moving expression of the title hero’s restless spirit. You might not believe that you could be so moved by a superhero movie about a grasshopper-man on a bike. You would be wrong.Now playing in theaters.',\n",

       "  'review_text': \"To be Black is to acknowledge the intrinsic impact that violence has, and continues to have, on our culture and history. To be Black is to see your identity relentlessly caricatured for propaganda but to claim your power in the face of deniers. Yet the cycles of mourning forced upon Black communities yield anger, exhaustion, and the question of how and where to channel it. Writer/directorBomani J. Story’s debut feature, “The Angry Black Girl and Her Monster,” confronts these realities through an Afro-surrealist sci-fi escapade. Vicaria (Laya DeLeon Hayes) is a precocious teenager with a penchant for science. She believes that death can be cured. When her older brother, Chris (Edem Atsu-Swanzy), is murdered in gang violence, she pursues her theory and brings him back to life. But what she discovers through his reanimation is not the sibling she knew. He is a shell—a monster of her own creation—and as her community reels from the violent spawn of her loss, she embarks on a path of danger and denial.There is a clear allusion toMary Shelley’sFrankensteinin the foundation of the film’s script. Aside from fun references, likeThe Modern Prometheusbeing written on Vicaria’s notebook, the film shows its true heart is in the reimagining and modernization of the “tragic monster.”Though Chris’ death is the film's inciting incident, generational trauma and the desire to supersede it is its lifeblood. The opening sequence contains a montage of emotional vignettes as Vicaria details her mother's death by street violence and laments that “death is the disease that broke [her] family.” It’s not only exposition that drives home these themes but also the film’s scope in painting a full portrait of the community, showing it through grit and love alike.Vicaria’s relationship with her father functions alongside their shared grief as the film's emotional core, as well as her close and often witty relationship with Aisha (Reilly Brooke Stith), Chris’ grieving girlfriend. On the opposing side are the local gangbangers, including Kango (Denzel Whitaker) and enforcer Jamaal (Keith Holliday), looming as a threat to the neighborhood. Yet Story’s script refuses to stereotype them as two-dimensional archetypal antagonists. As the narrative unfolds, we view the curves in their characters, and the thoughtfulness put into the supporting plots and cast pays off.The performances suffice across the board, but no one shines like DeLeon Hayes, who, in addition to being a wonderful scream queen when it’s called for, is versatile through everything the film requires. She is amusing in the asides of pure scientific mania and creates the film’s gravity with a firm tone and stiff upper lip against the odds, and piercing despair in the narrative’s emotional valleys.“The Angry Black Girl and Her Monster” has fun with its mad scientist nostalgia. Skittery CG lightning bolts, neon lighting, strobes, and a high magnitude score give way to kinetic energy that counters the day-to-day sequences well. In a tight 92-minute runtime, the film takes us through a community as a microcosm of culture, delivers shivering gore, and crafts characters worth caring about. The script can be a bit opaque when trying to squeeze in as many thesis-supporting scenarios as possible, but it also handles nuanced topics with grace, like the symbiotic relationship between underserved communities and drug abuse. And while\\xa0the film's desire to explain itself softens its edge a bit, it eventually recovers. “The Angry Black Girl and Her Monster” is a soulful, bloodied cry for control. Chris is reincarnated as a faceless, hooded Black man who silently wanders the community—a familiar cultural figure of unwarranted fear. This film’s intelligence lies in its subversion of expectation. Chris validates a stereotyped image against his will and by doing so, shoves a mirror in the face of culture, creating helpless fear and a tragic monster. For most of the film, he functions more as a phantom than a true terror. We see the trail of evidence he’s left behind, but his actions are more symbolic of the repercussions of cycles of disenfranchisement—the true disease of Vicaria’s monster. The violence, which cuts through the film with poignant vigor, is only the symptom.Now playing in theaters and available on demand.\",\n",

       "  'review_text': '“What Dali has done and what he has imagined is debatable, but in his outlook, his character, the bedrock decency of a human being does not exist. He is as anti-social as a flea. Clearly, such people are undesirable, and a society in which they can flourish has something wrong with it.” SoGeorge Orwellpronounced, in 1944, in an essay that was ostensibly a review of Salvador Dalí’s autobiography. Orwell is so frequently (and in many instances inaccurately) cited these days as a kind of secular prophet and ideological saint that it’s often forgotten that he was also a bit of a prig. Like many boys my age—okay, maybe not—I was a big Dalí fan in the late 1960s. I’m still awestruck by his 1931 paintingThe Persistence of Memory—yup, the melting clocks one—not just because of the genuine numinosity of the image but the craft. It really is meticulous, and on such a small canvas! It’s only nine by eleven inches. Its realistic components—the cliffs in the background—are beautifully detailed but not photorealistic. Rather, like the details in Rockwell—I think he’s good, too!—they’re poetically realistic. And while I’ve since grown to admire Max Ernst more than Dalí as far as surrealists go, I still dig the guy while acknowledging that his work, while maintaining a high standard of craft, didn’t reach the “real thing”ness ofMemorytoo often throughout his subsequent career. But he never stopped irritating people.By the 1970s, Salvador Dalí was more than a provocative painter. Like his pop art then-contemporaryAndy Warhol, he was a brand. A self-willed one, too; years before his Surrealist confrere sought to condemn Dalí with the anagrammatic nickname “Avida Dollars,” which the artist practically embraced. He and his wife Gala cast themselves as monied socialites, and while they did not make the acquaintance ofDon Henley—as this movie depicts, shock-rockerAlice Cooperwas more their speed—they threw outrageous parties and paid outrageous bills.Or did not pay them, depending. “Dalíland,” directed byMary Harron(“I Shot Andy Warhol,” “American Psycho”), shows the 1970s Dalí through the eyes of one James Linton. The frame story is the early ‘80s, after a disastrous electrical fire at a residence in Spain practically fries the now-widowed Dali. James, watching a report on television, is borne back into the past. Fresh out of an Idaho art school, now an assistant at the New York gallery repping Dalí, hunky James (Christopher Briney, who’s appealing and also, well, appealing) is sent to look after Dalí as he prepares for a show. Or is he meant to be a bait for Gala, who, James is told, has the libido of an electric eel? Hard to say. What is evident is that Dali’s social whirl is dizzying. There’s Alice Cooper, there’s Amanda Lear, the leggy model who may be a transsexual woman (played here byAndreja Pejic, who definitely is), there’s a guy called “Jesus” who’s really Jeff Fenholt, who’s in the Broadway company ofJesus Christ SuperstarAnd there’s Dalí, who holds forth on whether he created God or God created him and tells of his plans to construct a globe-spanning giant penis as his “contribution to world peace.” He seems exhausting. Dalí is portrayed byBen Kingsleyin the main story and byEzra Millerin flashbacks to Dalí’s youth. Not to make light of Ezra Miller’s troubles, but one thing both actors have in common is, for lack of a better phrase, mad charisma. And Kingsley adds dimension to that in the scenes in which Dalí’s willful quirks and taxing eccentricities run headlong into the mishaps and infirmities of old age. As Gala,Barbara Sukowais the stealth MVP of the movie, her wounded pride going in a straight line back to when she walked the street of Paris “until my shoes filled with blood” looking for a dealer to sell Dalí’s paintings. Now in a fierce state of ego decrepitude, she sponsors the no-talent Fenholt (who can’t even keep his electric guitar in tune) while grudgingly tending to her husband.The smarts this movie sometimes shows tend to underscore how this is Harron’s most conventional biographical consideration. The script, byJohn Walsh, features a subplot derived from “Almost Famous” in which a female Dalí groupie (dubbed “Ginestra” by the artist—her real name is Lucy—just as James is called “San Sebastian” by his eminence) tells James, “My father thinks Dalí is a pornographer which I love,” before sexually initiating him into the clan. Ducking a date for dinner with Dad, she clucks, “I have to make an appearance, or else my father won’t keep paying my rent.” Ar ar ar. I know people of this sort existed and still do, but surely there must be fresher ways of writing them.Suki Waterhousedoes her best with what she’s given. But still. The movie’s commonplaces don’t serve its singular subject—love him or hate him—all that well.Now playing in theaters and available on demand.',\n",

       "  'review_text': '“There’s more great literature written about fly fishing than any other sport.”This line comes early on in \"Mending the Line,\" and it really is so true! Norman Maclean\\'sA River Runs Through Itis probably the most famous example, but there are libraries more. Why this might be is an interesting question, and why fly fishing inspires such passionate advocates is another. \"Mending the Line,\" sensitively directed byJoshua Caldwelland written\\xa0byStephen Camelio, tells the story of two men, one old (Brian Cox), and one young (Sinqua Walls), who are veterans of two different wars. They find healing for their combat traumas, physical and emotional, in fly fishing and in their unlikely friendship. \"Mending the Line\" opens in Afghanistan, as a group of Marines, celebrating their final day of deployment, are sent out for one last patrol by their leader, Colter (Walls). Things go haywire. Many of the men under his command, including good friends, are killed, and Colter is severely injured. Back home, haunted by guilt and self-medicating\\xa0with alcohol, he lands in a veteran rehab facility in Montana. It seems like a good facility, with treatments tailored to the specific person\\'s issues. Dr. Burke (Patricia Heaton) recognizes Colter\\'s impatience to be healed, immediately, so he can get deployed again, but tries to get him to manage his expectations. He doesn\\'t take well to the group therapy, lashing out at the counselor, who never served. Colter is a mess.Ike (Cox), on the other hand, is decades past his own war but still makes periodic visits to the facility, especially after he blacks out while fly fishing by himself. Ike is a crotchety isolated guy, a former Marine, whose sole respite from his mental trouble is when he\\'s out on the river. Dr. Burke sets up Ike and Colter: Ike will teach Colter the ins and outs of fly fishing. They spend a lot of time at the local bait & tackle shop, run by Ike\\'s old friend Harrison (Wes Studi). Ike and Harrison know each other very well, and their dynamic is prickly, humorous, and familiar. Colter\\'s training has its bumps, but eventually, he\\'s out in the river, trying it for himself. (There\\'s a funny moment where Ike upbraids Colter for calling the fishing rod a \"pole,\" echoing a sentiment inA River Runs Through It: \"Always it was to be called a rod. If someone called it a pole, my father looked at him as a sergeant in the United States Marines would look at a recruit who had just called a rifle a gun.\")The third central character is Lucy (Perry Mattfeld), a librarian who volunteers at the rehab facility, reading to the veterans. Lucy is a troubled woman, anxious and distracted. Her back story isn\\'t revealed until later, but she clearly is haunted by something. She\\'s stuck, just like Ike and Colter. When Ike sends Colter to the library to get some books about fly fishing, Lucy gives himThe Sun Also Rises(forgetting that one of the main characters has been rendered impotent from a war injury). There may be a little spark of romantic interest between Lucy and Colter, but it\\'s on the slowest burns. The fly-fishing sequences are beautiful, and the Montana scenery is stunning. Bill Brown\\'s score is of the old-fashioned sweeping kind, and its use is heavy-handed, insisting on the scene\\'s emotion as opposed to supporting it. Watching Colter standing in the river, a big smile on his face when he casts out his line correctly, carries its own weight without orchestral underlining. Each character gets a lengthy monologue, where they tell their story and sum up their emotions. The cranky old-coot humor between Studi and Cox is a welcome break, and there could have been more of it. Ike, Colter, and Lucy are complex people struggling with entrenched problems which can\\'t be wished away. They do their best to survive and sometimes fail to rise above. This dynamic saves the film from sentimentality and some of its blunter tendencies towards self-conscious \"inspiration.\" Life is hard. You never heal completely. You just find ways to cope.Fly fishing as therapy for PTSD is a \"thing\" now; its popularity among veterans growing—andresearch supports the anecdotal. Fly fishing clubs for veterans have sprouted up everywhere in the country. It\\'s very moving to see photos of all the real veterans fly fishing underneath the end credits. \"Mending the Line\" is the first film to explicitly address this new and innovative treatment, showing it as a potential therapy for those who suffer in silence. Laure de Clermont-Tonnerre\\'s 2019 film \"The Mustang\" showed a prison program where convicts work with wild mustangs as therapy to manage the uncontrollable rage that has ruined their lives. \"The Mustang\" was a little bit harder-hitting than \"Mending the Line,\" but, for the most part, \"Mending the Line\" conveys its message well. It could point people who are hurting in a new and surprising direction, maybe even leading to a way out.Now playing in theaters.',\n",

       "  'review_text': 'AlthoughVadim Perelman’s “Persian Lessons” is credited as an adaptation of the short storyErfindung Einer SprachebyWolfgang Kohlhaase, the film begins with titles that read “Inspired by true events,” a nod to the film’s Holocaust setting. Though millions of Jewish people were imprisoned and killed in concentration camps during this time, this misguided drama, written byIlya Tsofin, isn’t interested in the truth of their stories. Instead, it’s a contrived triumph-of-the-human-spirit narrative where the Jewish character at the center is rendered a cipher for suffering while his Nazi tormentors are unconsciously humanized. We’re introduced to Gilles (Nahuel Pérez Biscayart), a Jewish man from Antwerp, after he’s been captured in France by the German Army. While being transported in a cramped truck to a concentration camp, he trades half a sandwich with a fellow passenger for a rare book of Persian tales. It’s unclear what he would get out of this trade. That is, until he later uses the book to evade a death squad by claiming he is actually Persian, not Jewish.This is the first of many contrived coincidences, followed immediately by another when the soldiers spare his life—after unceremoniously murdering all his fellow passengers—because their deputy commandant Koch (Lars Eidinger) has been looking for someone to teach him Farsi. Now answering to the name Reza, to whom the book had been inscribed, Gilles must work in the camp’s kitchens during the day and teach Koch Farsi at night, despite not knowing a lick of the language. In a move seemingly crafted solely for the big emotional payoff at the end of the film, Gilles/Reza uses the names in the camp’s ledger as a mnemonic device to create the 2,000 vocabulary words Koch hopes to learn so he can move to Tehran after the war.Mining the tension of whether the Nazis will murder a Jewish man or not is already a queasy way into this horrendous period, but that Tsofin’s screenplay does little to flesh out who Gilles/Reza actually is beyond his trauma makes it even more exploitative. The filmmakers then double down on their wrongheaded choices by not only attempting to humanize Koch, the Nazi, through this new teacher-student relationship—one whose power dynamics are barely explored—but also by spending more time with two scheming and jealous Nazis named Max (Jonas Nay) and Elsa (Leonie Benesch), who resent Gilles/Reza’s place in the camp.If you ever wanted a movie with a Nazi love triangle, a Nazi dance, Nazi gay panic, and jokes about the size of a Nazi commander’s dick, this is the movie for you. What’s worse is that this attempt at workplace drama doesn’t even give insight into the horrendous acts these characters perpetuate. In fact, at times, it almost seems to want to engender them to the audience. The jolts of humor that the many scenes with these characters bring to the film are completely out of place in this otherwise overly bleak production. Also, through their conversations, we learn more about the lives and desires of these Nazis than we ever do of Gilles/Reza. Who is he outside this present trauma? Who was he before the war? \"Persian Lessons\"\\xa0is a showcase for Biscayart’s polyglot abilities, but the narrative never bothers to explain why Gilles/Reza speaks multiple languages, nor how he can seemingly make up this brand new fake Farsi language.Eventually, the film deigns to introduce a few more Jewish characters, two brothers from Italy, only to use them as emotional fodder to further torture Gilles/Reza. Late in the movie,\\xa0when he chooses to sacrifice his freedom for one of them, Koch asks him why he would trade his life for one of these nameless people. Gilles/Reza replies, “They’re only nameless because you don’t know their names.”This moment is engineered to make an emotional impact on the audience. But it’s dulled completely as this shallow film can only seem to define the humanity of Gilles/Reza—and his fellow Jews—through their trauma and nothing more, while somehow giving more grace and texture to their tormentors.Biscayart does a lot of heavy lifting with his deeply felt performance, despite the lack of depth his character is afforded. His expressive, soulful eyes transmit more nuanced, truthful emotions than any of the film’s hackneyed dialogue. It is truly a testament to his talent that the film’s final moments, in which his mnemonic device plays a pivotal role, find any truth. \"Persian Lessons\" ends on yet another overly engineered scene, in which the names of thousands of dead are used to evoke a harrowing sadness, when the film never bothered to let us know them when they were alive.Now playing in theaters.',\n",

       "  'review_text': 'A small-town period piece set between World War I and the mid-1930s,\\xa0\"Scarlet\" is a French fable by an Italian director.\\xa0Although its style couldn\\'t be more different, its conception evokes Wes Anderson\\'s \"The French Dispatch,\" which was less a portrait of any era\\'s\\xa0\"real France\" than a world-traveling cinephile\\'s\\xa0love letter to French movies and archetypes. \"Scarlet\" is a bundle of stylistic contradictions, directed by longtime documentary filmmakerPietro Marcello, whose \"Martin Eden\" was one of the surprise art house success stories of 2019. With its abundance of natural landscapes and\\xa0rapturous sunlit-and-candlelit closeups, \"Scarlet\"\\xa0feels big even though its scope is constrained\\xa0(the characters rarely leave their small rural community in Normandy). And although it emphasizes the poverty and\\xa0harsh\\xa0physical challenges\\xa0of the characters\\' lives, repeatedly returning to closeups of a manual laborer\\'s swollen, dirt-caked hands, \"Scarlet\" also indulges in flights of fancy that have a \"what the heck, let\\'s try it\" quality. Some\\xa0flights are literal: one of the central characters is a handsome barnstormer who falls in love with our heroine Juliette (Juliette Jouan), a lovely, fierce\\xa0young woman who grows up under the tutelage of her widowed war veteran-handyman-sculptor father Raphaël (Raphaël Thiéry). She\\xa0plays piano, has a lovely singing voice, and likes to bathe in the local stream, read poetry and novels under shady trees, and gaze at others with longing, sadness, or resentment. There are also trace elements of ancient fairy tales in the script: the heroine\\'s guardian (Noémie Lvovsky)\\xa0tries to teach\\xa0Juliette magic while lamenting its diminished importance in the era of automobiles, airplanes, and mass-produced machinery. Another recurring character is sort of a Gallic Baba Yaga: an old woman played byYolande Moreauwho lives alone in the woods when she\\'s not drinking at the local pub,\\xa0and appears to Juliette at transitional moments in her life, predicting her future,\\xa0speaking in aphorisms, and smiling sweetly.Cinematographer Marco Graziaplena\\'s soft, grainy, 16mm\\xa0camerawork favors\\xa0classic handheld \"documentary-style\" shots, relying on zoom lenses and shake to suggest immediacy.\\xa0But it\\'s in service of a\\xa0lower-budget version of the sorts\\xa0of epic melodramas that were regularly made\\xa0in the middle part of the 20th century. There are\\xa0hexagonal\\xa0lens flares, lyrical montages, a few straight-out musical numbers with \"a cappella\" vocals and offscreen piano or orchestra occasionally\\xa0chiming in as backup, and some of the situations that would\\'ve fit right into a silent movie about suffering innocents who can\\'t catch a break. (There are even clips of actual silent films, as well as documentary footage of French life at that time, integrated with\\xa0the rest of the story.)The film begins with\\xa0Raphaël\\xa0returning home from the war to find that his wife has died in his absence, leaving his infant daughter to be raised by the farm\\'s owner, her blacksmith, and his wife. Soon after,\\xa0Raphaël  learns that an arrogant businessman in town raped his wife.\\xa0But although he\\'s distraught and wants bloody revenge, the situation resolves itself in a surprising way that foreshadows developments in the rest of the film, which is less about the possibility or impossibility of making one\\'s own way in life than the necessity of finding the strength to accept\\xa0whatever it throws at you and seek happiness regardless. The most film\\'s affecting parts show\\xa0Raphaël and various younger versions of Juliette developing a rapport that owes more than a bit to almost every cinematic version of \"Beauty and the Beast.\" But it combines the father-daughter and beauty-beast relationships by\\xa0bestowing movie-star close-ups on the leading lady while\\xa0filming Thiéry to emphasize his prominent brow, sunken eyes, broad shoulders, knotty hands, and limping walk. Creativity is the core of their connection. We\\'d probably instantly buy it even if the film had merely told us about it, thanks to the chemistry between Thiéry and the three actresses who play Juliette at different stages of life.But Marcello and his four credited screenwriters (who\\xa0pulled the story from\\xa0adventure novelist\\xa0Alexander Grin\\'sScarlet Sails)\\xa0are greatly helped by the fact that the two leads are multi-talented. Thiéry came to acting later in life after a long career as an accomplished professional\\xa0artist (and amateur musician; he plays accordion and\\xa0tunes a piano onscreen, and the camera and sound recording\\xa0make sure you know he can actually do both things). Jouan\\xa0is a more polished musician who can actually sing and play. Both have been recorded in a way that convinces us that they\\'re playing or singing, not merely approximating an instrumental performance or\\xa0lip-synching to a prerecorded track\\xa0(although Jouan seems to do\\xa0the latter in a musical number that unfolds as Juliette swims).Even more impressive are the many\\xa0scenes where Raphaël fixes things or makes art. The camera gets close to Thiéry\\'s powerful hands so that we can see that he really could get a job\\xa0as a carpenter,\\xa0repair a defective machine part, and\\xa0carve a ship\\'s prow from a block of wood with such precision that the visiting barnstormer Jean, a charismatic carouser with an Errol Flynn mustache\\xa0(soulful hunkLouis Garrel, the exact person you\\'d want to cast in a part like this),\\xa0instantly knows it\\'s modeled on the girl he loved\\xa0at first sight (and first listen; Jean and Juliette are swimming in different parts of the river when he hears her singing and searches for the source of that voice). \"Scarlet\"\\xa0moves according to its own distinctive rhythm. It\\'s\\xa0slower and more contemplative than modern audiences are conditioned to accept, and it frequently surrenders to\\xa0its muse, like its\\xa0characters. You\\'ll settle into a comfortable\\xa0groove with the film when it\\'s showing people doing complicated tasks with their bare hands in loving closeup, and thenbang, here comes a full-length musical number, an interlude introducing the aviator and his partner in flight,\\xa0or a scene of potential violence or violation (like her mother,\\xa0Juliette is targeted with unwanted affection\\xa0by a local punk who thinks they\\'re destined to be together and won\\'t take no for an answer). It\\'s all over the place, and if there was a way to unify all of its\\xa0disparate elements, the filmmaker never quite figured it out. You just have to agree that it\\'s all of a piece and accept it isn\\'t going to settle into any one mode for very long.Still, the movie\\'s stubborn insistence on going where inspiration takes it is\\xa0fascinating. Fans of European art cinema with a retro flavor will want to check it out just for the combination of Jacques Demy-inspired musical numbers (imagine characters from\\xa0\"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg\" transplanted to a farm town); Terrence Malick-inflected shots of grass, trees, sky, water, and animals; and intimate, intense scenes of characters from an earlier time doing\\xa0what they have to do to survive and be happy.Now playing in theaters.',\n",

       "  'review_text': 'Ocean waves crashing in slow motion. Solar panels sprawling as far as the eye can see. A port worker stacking multicolored shipping containers. A little boy staring blankly at a screen.These striking images and so many more comprise the poetic documentary “Users.” The latest fromNatalia Almada, which earned her the documentary directing award at the 2021 Sundance Film Festival, is a mesmerizing amalgamation of sight and sound. As producer, writer, director, and editor, the Mexican-American filmmaker has crafted a feast for the senses. Working with her husband, music and sound designerDave Cerf, and her brother-in-law, cinematographerBennett Cerf, Almada vividly explores the increasing encroachment of technology and automation into the natural world. She creates a vibe that feels like an eerie stream of consciousness, often accompanied by the dark, melancholy strings of the Kronos Quartet. But her mission is also clearly personal, as she incorporates footage of her two young sons, a toddler and an infant, playing in a bathtub, finger painting, or napping. The video of her younger son taking his tentative first steps at a park is far more artful than anything the rest of us could ever capture on our iPhones.So, yes, back to technology. Almada wonders early on in her frequent narration how its omnipresence will shape her children’s upbringing, serving almost as a second mother. “Will they love her more?” she ponders. “Will they love her perfection more than my imperfection?” Her understated tones, coupled with the crisp minimalism of Bennett Cerf’s wondrous cinematography, create a hypnotic mood.And yet, because “Users” is so captivating from a technical perspective, it’s frustrating to discover how scattered it is narratively. Besides worrying about the perils of machines at the expense of humanity—not exactly a novel concept—Almada expands her scope as she goes along in a way that dilutes whatever message she might have had. It’s like she’s trying to get her arms around too much at once, even though the film runs barely over 80 minutes. The result is a strange contradiction: that “Users” could be so precise and controlled from an audiovisual perspective yet meander so much in its storytelling. It makes you wonder whether Almada should have made a series of shorts on a variety of topics instead.Terrifying footage of a California wildfire—growing from a smolder and crackle to a devastating rager—is a detour, but at least it speaks to the climate change crisis, which tangentially connects it to the rest of her cause. But by the time she visits an elderly oil man, lamenting the loss of his pals while singing and stroking his sweet chihuahua companion, Little Bit, it’s like: What are we doing here? What is the point of this? Other musings aren’t as profound as she perhaps intended them to be: People didn’t always know the gender of their babies before giving birth, people used to drive to work and get stuck in traffic, people never had enough time. (We still don’t, actually.) But eventually, Almada brings it back around in a way that’s more focused, as she takes the potentially ominous nature of artificial intelligence and makes it intimate. It’s a topic that couldn’t be more relevant, especially given the current Writers Guild strike. We see her in a recording booth, reading a series of phrases and giving permission for her voice to be used for this purpose. Later, we hear both the AI and authentic versions of her voice uttering the same words as her baby sleeps.The fact that there’s only the slightest difference between them is chilling, raising one of many questions for which there are no quick and easy answers.Now playing in theaters.',\n",

       "  'review_text': 'Although it\\'s being sold as aLeBron Jamesbiopic,\\xa0\"Shooting Stars\"\\xa0ends before James has\\xa0even begun his\\xa0records-shattering\\xa0career as an NBA\\xa0player. Nearly all of its\\xa0two-hour running time focuses on the relationships between young James (played by acting newcomerMookie Cook, a small forward for Compass Prep in Jefferson, Oregon);\\xa0his three best friends; their parents; their schoolmates, and their community. And every\\xa0moment and image is so perfectly shaped and\\xa0presented, and rings so true, that you can imagine the same story being told, beat-for-beat,\\xa0with a cast of invented characters and being every bit\\xa0as satisfying. The film\\xa0will be classified as a sports movie, and it deserves that designation: basketball is the glue that binds it. But it\\'s ultimately notaboutbasketball, or even sports. It\\'s about what happens to a group of close friends when one of them turns out to be so great\\xa0at his favorite thing\\xa0that it would be a sin not to let him move on in life and keep doing\\xa0it at the level his talent deserves.\\xa0This is\\xa0one of the great films about young male friendship, right up there with \"I Vitelloni,\" \"Boyz N the Hood,\" \"Mean Streets,\" \"Cooley High,\"\\xa0\"The Wood,\"\\xa0and \"Stand By Me.\"Directed byChris Robinson, who helmed the Netflix movie \"Beats\" and came up through TV ads, and adapted byFrank E. Flowers,Tony RettenmaierandJuel Taylorfrom the bestseller by James and H.G. \"Buzz\" Kissinger (\"Friday Night Lights\"),\"Shooting Stars\" follows the \"Boyz\" template, giving us a\\xa0prologue—so packed with detail it\\'s\\xa0practically a compacted\\xa0first act—with James and his friends as elementary schoolers, then jumps ahead to\\xa0follow them\\xa0through four years of high school. They\\'re a\\xa0tight crew from a working class neighborhood. They call themselves the Fab Four.\\xa0Their days and nights revolve around basketball:\\xa0when they aren\\'t actually on the paint, they\\'re playing basketball video games and fantasizing about their pro ball careers.\\xa0The screenwriters distribute their attention democratically\\xa0among the four. All\\xa0get\\xa0exciting, funny, or sorrowful moments. The movie is\\xa0not about LeBron James and everyone else. It\\'s the tale of\\xa0four friends, one of whom happens to be LeBron James.Besides James, there\\'s Sian Cotton (Khalil Everage), whose wit as as fast as his reflexes; Willie McGee (Avery Wills), a hardy\\xa0ally and a bit of a daredevil; and\\xa0Dru Joyce III (Caleb McLaughlin), whose thoughtful and rock-steady\\xa0dad Dru II (Wood Harris)\\xa0coaches their team. Dru III is the film\\'s breakout character, not just because McLaughlin, whose live-wire edge gives off Baby Tupac vibes, is such an exciting actor, but because the character is a real life scene-stealer: a small guy with a big heart, a warrior\\'s nerve, and the skills to back up his bravado. It\\'s Dru III who\\xa0hears his dad predict that once they\\xa0feed into\\xa0Buchtel High School, the local public high school, the Fab Four will have to split up because the program will\\xa0put the short kid on junior varsity, and gets the rest excited about applying instead to a mostly white local Catholic high school, St.\\xa0Vincent-St. Mary.\\xa0And it\\'s Dru who approaches the Catholic school\\'s incoming head basketball coach Keith Dambrot (Dermot Mulroney) and overcomes his skepticism about Dru\\'s pitch to bring in all\\xa0four friends, including this bite-sized, motormouthed one,\\xa0by sinking a series of consecutive, nearly\\xa0immaculate three-pointers.Most \"based on a true story\"\\xa0films\\xa0would have given this sort of moment, which breaks the needle on the Badass-O-Meter, to the young LeBron James instead.\\xa0But it was Dru\\'s moment in life, so he\\'s the one who claims it onscreen. There\\'s an integrity to this choice and so many more that not only gives \"Shooting Stars\"\\xa0a central, guiding integrity but heart as well. This is not a movie that lives by the cynical maxim of screenwriterWilliam Goldmanthat a Hollywood script needs to \"give the star everything.\" The funniest lines invariably pop out of the mouth of Sian (when they\\'re all sharing a room at a La Quinta motel during a road game, and somebody asks what La\\xa0Quinta means, he deadpans, \"It means you flunked Spanish, fool\"). When a tall\\xa0new kid with a scary reputation\\xa0named Romeo Travis (NBA G playerScoot Henderson) enrolls at\\xa0St. Vincent-St. Mary, and the Fab Four befriend him rather than believe the negative hype and steer clear, it isn\\'t just a way for the film to needlessly restate that the Fab Four are wonderful guys; Romeo gets woven into the story and proves central to some of its most exciting and moving moments of friendship and generosity. The same democratic storytelling spirit is applied\\xa0to the supporting characters, especially the\\xa0parents and coaches. Each could anchor their own movie that retold young\\xa0LeBron James\\'s story from a singular perspective.\\xa0Harris is perfect as a soft-spoken, empathetic father who knows how to soften the sting of bad news, and delivers rousing speeches not just by raising his voice, but making every listener feel the truth of his words.\\xa0As James\\'s mother Gloria,Natalie Paul(of \"The Deuce\" and \"Power\") is so elegant and understated—and connects so intuitively with Cook, a screen natural who doesn\\'t so much perform as exist—that all of the\\xa0mom-and-son scenes attain uncanny intimacy. It\\'s\\xa0as if you\\'re a silent witness to the sorts of\\xa0small but defining\\xa0exchanges that films rarely think to depict. (Among its other virtues, this film is further validation of what we already know to be true:\\xa0many of the most important moments in a young person\\'s life\\xa0occur\\xa0at the kitchen table or on the living room sofa.)\\xa0Mulroney isn\\'t in the film much—this is true to life;\\xa0the real Dambrot left St. Vincent-St.\\xa0Mary before the end of his first season to coach the Duquesne Dukes—but he makes a strong impression, reinforcing the character\\'s plot function, which is to foreshadow James\\'s inevitable ascent to the NBA pantheon and remind both the young heroes and the audience that sometimes life offers you opportunities so great that to refuse to pursue them would be a crime, not just against one\\'s own potential, but against friends and family whose encouragement got you to\\xa0that point.Robinson\\'s direction, Karsten Gopinath\\'s cinematography, Jo Francis\\'s editing, and Mark Isham\\'s score work harmoniously to put across the text and subtext of each moment, large or small,\\xa0while also\\xa0infusing them with additional layers of meaning. Playful drone shots zoom along behind a bicyclist; zip through an open window and follow an actor through a small apartment; and (incredibly) follow the ball through a hoop after a dunk. These moments are\\xa0a visual corollary for that elating feeling you get when your mind,\\xa0body and spirit are\\xa0are so attuned that you feel as if physics can\\'t restrain you.\\xa0Even spectacular\\xa0compositions have meaning and purpose. An\\xa0overhead shot of the Catholic school team and its Black players doing pre-practice stretches on a gym floor emblazoned with huge cartoon leprechauns sums up the heroes\\' cultural context better than dialogue could.Most of the film\\'s scenes are as short as can be, because this is not an epic and doesn\\'t aspire to become one. But at the same time,\\xa0you never feel as if relevant\\xa0side issues are being ignored or minimized to make viewers feel good. Notice, for instance, how \"Shooting Stars\" weaves in racism by white characters against Black ones, as well as intra-racial or class-based anxiety. The latter is steeped in\\xa0bad blood between\\xa0Black players and parents who\\'ve decided to pursue success and social advancement at a white Catholic academy and those who\\'ve pledged their loyalty to the\\xa0neighborhood Black public high school that has baked-in social credibility but fewer resources. You can see each side\\'s point, and neither is wrong.\\xa0A\\xa0lot of the wider tensions enfolding the characters are\\xa0presented this way. This, too, feels true-to-life.\\xa0Some problems can\\'t be solved by individuals; they\\'re systemic, and\\xa0that\\'s why they persist.\\xa0Rather than force a naive and unbelievable outcome, \"Shooting Stars\"\\xa0has the confidence to let us accept unresolved conflicts and sit with them.\\xa0(Here, too, though, the movie makes sure to add humor whenever possible, even in otherwise tense scenes; when one character calls another a sellout, the target of the insult shouts,\\xa0\"Who you callin\\' a sellout, Tony? You still owe me a hundred dollars!\")Love is the word. When a movie loves its characters and story as much as this one, and dedicates every aspect of filmmaking and performance to doing them justice, and consistently puts virtuosity in service of meaning, the result conjures a feeling that\\'s close to what you experience when someone you adore has a great and richly deserved\\xa0success, and you\\'re privileged to be able to\\xa0witness it and cheer them on.Now playing on Peacock.',\n",

       "  'review_text': 'Take one part “A Beautiful Mind.” Add a few dashes of “Euphoria.” Sprinkle in some Oscar bait-style writing, cinematography, and a ceaseless strings-heavy score. Èt voila! You have the utterly pointless and eminently skippable limited series that is “The Crowded Room.” At best, these 10 hours of Apple TV’s latest drama will provide some background noise while you fold laundry, but at worst, this is the shallowest dramatic exploration of mental illness in some time.It is beyond the scope of this reviewer’s imagination to wonder what exactly creator and head writerAkiva Goldsman, best known for writing the John Nash biopic that won four Academy Awards (and, less illustriously, “The Da Vinci Code” and “Angels and Demons”), was thinking. The plot, loosely adapted fromDaniel Keyes’ nonfiction novelThe Minds of Billy Milligan, follows Danny Sullivan (Tom Holland, once again playing a traumatized teenager a la “The Devil All the Time”) starting in the summer of 1979. Danny lives in upstate New York with his meek mother, Candy (Emmy Rossum), and abusive stepfather Marlin (Will Chase), and mourns\\xa0the loss of his twin brother Adam, who appears in childhood flashbacks. A talented artist but unpopular in school,\\xa0Danny is too\\xa0anxious to socialize beyond two close friends, happy-go-lucky magician Johnny (Levon Hawke) and skilled athlete Mike (Sam Vartholomeos). Life at home and school is tough. So, one day, after being rescued from a beating at the hands of bullies by new neighbor Yitzak Safdie (Lior Raz), Danny moves in with the relative stranger across the street from his own. Ariana (Sasha Lane), an emotionally distant young woman who seems to party hard and cry even harder, lives there too. After learning Ariana continues to fear her childhood rapist will track her down, Danny obtains a gun for her to feel safe. She refuses the gift, and after some muddled storytelling, she and Danny eventually wind up in Rockefeller Center, trailing Ariana’s rapist. Danny tries to shoot but freezes. Ariana takes the gun and fires a few shots, grazing the man’s arm. After a brief interlude, Danny is arrested at Yitzak’s house, and no one can find Safdie or Ariana.Thus enters the plot device that frames most of the series. Doctor Rya Goodwin (Amanda Seyfried) is a professor of psychology called onto the case by Detective Matty Dunn (Thomas Sadoski). She proceeds to have a series of sessions with Danny, to try and understand his plight in time for a proper defense at trial. Since she’s determined to have certain ignored mental illness diagnoses recognized by the DMS (now known as the DSM), Goodwin’s characterization is marked by a series of trite feminist tropes: difficult relationship with ex-husband, overbearing mother, tantrum-prone child. These subplots need depth and nuance, not casual girl-boss framing.Seyfried does a fairly good job with what she’s been given and gains momentum by doing plenty of acting with her eyes. Indeed, this show might have worked better as a two-person play without grandiose sequences in other countries or melodramatic staging. Even the lighting and direction feel right out of the early aughts, which bizarrely makes sense since this project was originally slated back in the 1990s to be directed byJames Cameronand later byJoel Schumacher. It’s as though the general idea never really left that gestation period. Even the sixth episode, directed by TV veteranAlan Taylor, cannot be rescued from its writing, nor should it take six to\\xa0seven hour-long episodes for a story to fully reveal and heighten its stakes. Still, there’s Holland, who, like frequent scene partner Seyfried, brings considerable pathos and effort to the role. I cannot be too specific about what he does or why he does it, but there are glimmers of a truly tremendous actor in him. He conveys lightness and joy with equal surefootedness as he does moments of unimaginable emotional devastation. The problem, I fear, is his choice of projects. Perhaps playing a relentlessly heavy role like Danny Sullivan is a reprieve and a welcome challenge compared to the grind of playing Marvel’s Spider-Man. But there are not too many differences between this ceaselessly dark exploration of mental illness and, say, “Precious.” Both feature great performances, agony, and to some degree, a sense of realism, but neither transcends the bounds of artistic imagination. And frankly,\\xa0both are interminably dark, so when they insist on sprinkling hope fairy dust all over the narrative, the audience is robbed of the story’s honesty. (In contrast, HBO’s “Barry” is a hilarious,\\xa0terrific exploration of trauma and PTSD with 30-minute episodes; the same is true for FX’s “You’re the Worst,” to date the TV show that comes closest to portraying my own severe depression and anxiety.) By the time “The Crowded Room” started pulling Raymond Burr-era “Perry Mason”-esque tricks in the courtroom, I was annoyed beyond belief anyone would think this was a reasonable way to depict how mentally ill folks are treated by the American criminal justice system.Somewhere, deep down in this tragic tale of a young man struggling with his mental health, there\\'s a good story, a universal one, about how this country’s nonexistent social safety net constantly and spectacularly fails vulnerable groups: children, the mentally ill, abused partners, people of color. But when you try to tell that story with lines of dialogue that areneverexplained, and dollop in B-roll of late 1970s New York that looks like it was filmed with a completely\\xa0different camera than the one used on the actors, and add a smorgasbord of Hollywood’s cliches of mental health, you cannot succeed. Creating awareness and sending a message are all very well. The quality of the art you use in the process\\xa0matters too.The entire season was screened for review. The first three episodes of \"The Crowded Room\"\\xa0are available on Apple TV+ on June 9th.',\n",

       "  'review_text': 'The bittersweet Korean drama “Aloners” works best when it’s a character study about an isolated thirtysomething’s behavior instead of whatever her creators think should be done about it. Call center ace Jina (Gong Seung-yeon) doesn’t get completely pigeonholed by her age or stereotypically millennial intolerances until her story wraps up, at which point her problems get swept under the rug for the sake of a tidy sort of catharsis. Before then, “Aloners” humanizes Jina’s standoffish but relatable attitude by suggesting that it’s not just one thing that makes her act like she does—it’s everything. Jina is a little too good at her customer service job, which might be surprising if you saw her outside of work. She keeps to herself, blocking out noise with her earbud headphones, smoking alone, and watching cooking shows and other online series at her regular lunch break ramen shop counter. She’s still the best at what she does because she doesn’t react emotionally to her obnoxious clients, who usually call to complain about their credit cards. Jina sticks to her script of prompts. She’s efficient and polite, and her performance stands out to her needy and otherwise impersonal boss (Kim Hannah). So it’s up to Jina to train wide-eyed twentysomething Sujin (Jung Da-eun), who’s inexperienced and a little too clingy.Then again, what isn’t too much, according to Jina? The title “Aloners” is misleading because the movie’s almost exclusively about Jina, not Jina and Sujin, or her boss, her chatty estranged father (Park Jeong-hak), or her awkward next-door neighbor (Kim Mo-beom). Most of these supporting characters don’t have names because they don’t play major parts in Jina’s life; only Sujin makes an impression, mostly because she shares the same cubicle as Jina, which leads to some sitcom awkwardness (try this breath spray, you’ll like it!).There are a few moments where these side characters try to coax Jina out of her shell. Her refusal to leave isn’t as remarkable as her creators’ refusal to make her. She talks to her unfortunate neighbor with the same well-oiled aloofness she uses to escape deeper conversations with her father and her boss. Jina’s one-sided relationship with her dad sometimes looks like the elephant in the room that explains away her over-sensitivity. It never does, not even when she finally learns how to deal with him and his breathless one-sided conversations. She forces her way through awkward conversations with such well-honed skill that it sometimes seems effortless. It’s the world that’s unreasonable, not Jina or her careful, minimal engagement. It is frustrating to see Jina’s creators try to pull their stubborn antiheroine out of the corner that she finally realizes she’s painted herself into. Until then, Jina occupies a cramped emotional pocket universe of her own. Working this routine—work, smoke, lunch, more work, then a microwaveable meal and TV before bed—can relieve everyday problems. But not always.Sujin eventually cracks up during a phone call with a rude customer, so Jina steps in to help her. And while Jina goes through the motions of apologizing to the obnoxious caller, Sujin’s voice floats above her reluctant mentor’s call center banter: “Why should I apologize?” Sujin whispers. “I didn’t do anything wrong.”For a while, Sujin’s question provides the clearest and hardest dramatic guideline for Jina and her story. The non-committal way that she handles her problems is obviously flawed, but her actions still not only make sense, based on the information available to her (and us) but also credibly reflect how imposing the world outside of her head can be.Nobody needs to be told that working—and socializing and living—today can be alienating. Rather, “Aloners” goes deeper than most other similar dramas by showing how various social entanglements ask us to quietly accept inane or unfair social obligations. I really admire how hard writer/director Hong Seong-eun worked to keep Jina elusive, not only because it makes “Aloners\" more dramatic (and often quite funny) but also because it shows an unusual respect and unsentimental attachment for Jina, a very real character who could have easily seemed ungenerous or self-absorbed.Jina is not a problem to be solved, even though the end of “Aloners” suggests otherwise. The best scenes in Hong’s movie still reflect the ambient dread and solitary ecstasies of being a loner, especially if the lifestyle you’ve half-chosen and half-fallen into makes being apart from others seems like the best possible coping strategy. There’s nothing wrong with how Jina’s story ends, but it’s even more thrilling to see Hong let Jina be alone without prescribing what’sreallygoing on with her. There are obvious reasons for and answers to Jina’s problems, but they never completely explain her away.Now playing in theaters.',\n",

       "  'review_text': 'Reviewing the Pink Floyd albumWish You Were Herein 1975, critic Robert Christgau concluded his praise of the record (he gave it an \"A-,\" the highest grade he’d ever give the band) by declaring, “And the cover/liner art is worthy of all the stoned raps it has no doubt already inspired.”That cover/liner art was a multi-leveled thing. First of all, in the days when “albums” were presented on twelve-inch slabs of vinyl as a matter of course, if not default (Wish You Were Herewas very big on 8-track too), Pink Floyd’s long-awaited follow-up toDark Side of the Mooncame shrink-wrapped in opaque plastic, kind of deep puke green in color. There was a little sticker attached to the top corner of the shrink wrap with the band’s name and the album’s name in a circle, in the center of which was a sci-fi graphic of a robot handshake. Some record collectors never removed the shrink wrap from the album, merely slitting it open on the side where the sleeve containing the vinyl was. As one figure in this documentary directed byAnton Corbijnnotes, doing this, in a sense, rendered the album title almost literal. If you did take off the shrink wrap, the cover image, a photograph on what looked like a Hollywood studio backlot (because it was) depicting two men shaking hands, greeted you. One of the men was on fire. A postcard inside the sleeve showed a pair of legs sticking out of a body of water as if capturing a perfect dive at a high shutter speed. But, of course, it was a stunt swimmer standing on his head underwater. The photographer, Aubrey “Po” Powell, recalls that he still gets goosebumps thinking of taking that shot.Powell co-founded Hipgnosis, the design firm that defined and redefined album cover art from the psychedelic sixties through more indulgent and decadent times. Its other founder, Storm Thorgerson, who died in 2013, was the subject of a 2011 documentary called “Taken By Storm,” which I haven’t seen. But this account, while at a disadvantage due to Thorgerson’s absence, has a leg up due to director Corbijn’s keen sense of visual pertinence—prior to becoming a film director, he was a rock photographer of high distinction—and his professional connections, which likely enabled him to get fresh interviews not just with the Pink Floyd members who were in the prior documentary, but additional heavy hitters likePaul McCartney,Robert Plant,Noel Gallagher(not a Hipgnosis client, but here fulfilling the role usually played by Bono in such docs, that is, “Mr. Contemporary Context”) and more.Shot in the black and white that Corbijn favors in his still photography (and which he used for his debut feature “Control,” about the doomed Joy Division singer Ian Curtis), except, of course, when it breaks out the dazzling color work done by Hipgnosis itself, “Squaring the Circle” makes the still-living Powell its focus and fulcrum. He first appears with a giant Hipgnosis portfolio tied to his back by a rope—his legacy and the weight he’s gonna carry a long time. He tells the story in personal terms. Moving to London in his late teens, he’s attracted to a house nearby where the people drifting in and out are the most interesting that he’s ever seen. Eventually, he gets the gumption to go in. It’s a crash pad, and among the crashers are Syd Barrett andRoger Watersand Storm Thorgerson. Mostly they’re sitting around getting stoned and listening to jazz records. But soon, they set about creating. Syd and Roger form Pink Floyd. Storm and “Po” study fine art and photography at the Royal Academy. The musical friends ask the graphic friends to concoct artwork for an album cover. Influenced by pop art and psychedelics, the duo put together the cover for Floyd’s second album,A Saucerful of Secrets. They take their name from something someone spraypainted on the door of the crash pad. “Hip,” that means hip. “Gnosis,” that’s knowledge. Hipgnosis. Groovy. Who painted it on the door? In classic “if you lived through the sixties, you don’t remember it” fashion, recollections differ. Some say Barrett. Some say a person less famous. Some say a person less famous than that.Powell recounts how LSD caused some casualties, including Barrett. An interesting irony aboutWish You Were Hereis that a discombobulated, bald, overweight Syd Barrett showed up at Abbey Road studios while the band was recording this homage to Syd and elegy for the sixties that Syd helped define, for better or worse. We learn here that before going to the studio, Barrett showed up at the Hipgnosis office, asking for his old mate Storm. He was directed to the recording studio, where Storm, a ferocious idea man, was watching the proceedings and brainstorming so to speak.“He was a man who could not take yes for an answer,” one interviewee says of Thorgerson. Powell is visually shaken, silent, and tearful when discussing the business rift that estranged him and Thorgerson for over a decade starting in 1980. He says that just as huge financial success sowed seeds of discord in Pink Floyd that today still resonates in the sniping that goes on between Roger Waters andDavid Gilmour, so too did the size and cultural impact of Hipgnosis make the already rocky—but always respectful and affectionate—personal relationship between the founders untenable. Before the heartbreak, there are outlandish and often funny stories about iconic album covers. (As in deep background on the stunt person who got set on fire for theWish You Were Herecover.) And, if you’re interested, there’s a glimpse of the softer side of the quarrelsome Roger Waters, who at one point frankly and tenderly says, “I loved Storm. I still love Storm.” Shine on, as the saying goes.Now playing in theaters.',\n",

       "  'review_text': 'The fawning docuseries “Arnold” repackagesArnold Schwarzenegger’s already well-spun and streamlined biography. In three hour-long episodes devoted to his three major careers (bodybuilder, movie actor, and politician), Schwarzenegger provides negligible on-camera and voiceover-narrated commentary for movie clips, old and new talking head interviews, and self-congratulatory pep-talk commentary about his life, whose selectively remembered setbacks all set up him for some future, uncritically vaunted success. The greatest pleasures in this overproduced miniseries will only please pre-existing fans, who have either already bought what Schwarzenegger’s now reselling—the unstoppable foreigner and people’s hero who overcame great adversity and achieved his wildest dreams—or just want to see the ex-Governator skittishly namedrop career lowlights like “The Villain” and “Batman and Robin” before and after new soundbites fromSylvester StalloneandJames Cameronthat make Schwarzenegger look better.Schwarzenegger cocks a schticky eyebrow and puffs on evenly-lit cigars while admiring coffee table-sized books filled with high-resolution photos of himself from over the years. He has a PR-friendly anecdote or take for almost every moment in his public life, from the first time he met his ex-wifeMaria Shriver(and complimented her ass to her mom Eunice) to his extramarital affair with Mildred Patricia Baena, and their son Joseph, both of whom he acknowledges in “Arnold.”That stuff’s old news, or old enough that it can be used to embellish the Austrian Oak’s progress narrative, which only makes brief stops at major life events, like the death of his brother Meinhard or the box office failure of “Last Action Hero,” to shrug them off with platitudinous grace.Arnold waves away the boisterous, bullying media persona that he and his people have pumped up for decades now, calling it so much “smäh,” a German word that he translates as “bullshit” (more like a jokey con job). It’s sort of amusing to see Schwarzenegger soften history to his whims, going so far as to sparingly acknowledge theL.A. Timesand theircriticalinvestigativereporting, including some light talking head interviews with reporters Mark Z. Barabak and Carla Hall. He apologizes, again, for having “behaved badly.”Schwarzenegger also dismisses antisemitism as “a horrible, loser ideology” in a clip from one of his recent social-media fireside chats. That line complements his recent claims about havingonlyadmired Hitler’s way with words, not his Nazi politics, which probably plays better if you either don’t remember or care about the part ofthat 1992Spy Magazinearticleon Schwarzenegger where writer Charles Fleming confirms the rumor that Schwarzenegger used to gift people with records of Hitler’s speeches. Schwarzenegger also says nothing about his abusive father Gustav’s voluntary service with the Nazis, presumably because he flicked away that association in his 2012 memoir,Total Recall: My Unbelievably True Life Story. People only bring up the past when they want to smear you, Schwarzenegger suggests in footage from a 2003 press conference. (“You know, when you get into politics, they try to tear down your character, tear down everything you stand for.”)Your tolerance for this much smäh will depend on how much you like Schwarzenegger’s shimmering present-tense narrative. (About working on “End of Days” after undergoing heart surgery: “This is a new day. Let’s just move forward.”) Some will find the sheer length of “Arnold” to be punishing enough, while others will puzzle over a clueless narrative full of ersatz values, like when Schwarzenegger repeatedly conflates the worth and the box office performance of his various star vehicles (“Twins” was apparently great!), and then piles on pseudo-inspirational lines like, “Nietzsche was right, that that what does not kill you, will make you stronger.\" Schwarzenegger deploys that last paraphrase right after he talks about his brother’s death, calling Meinhard “delicate” and speculating that his dead sibling simply couldn’t take their father’s abuse.There’s almost enough truth in all this smäh to make it seem credible, like when Schwarzenegger remembers wearing down doubters like “Conan the Barbarian” producerDino De Laurentiis, who at first didn’t like Schwarzenegger’s accent. Never mind that Schwarzenegger insinuates more than he actually says, adds little to what he’s previously said, and often makes weird asides, like how America in the 1960s and 1970s “had problems” like \"the Manson murders and protests against the Vietnam War,\" which suggests that “Hippies were rising up.”The relentless march of time might still make you more susceptible to “Arnold” and its slick, consistently unbelievable revisionism. “We are the last dinosaurs,” Stallone says of himself and Schwarzenegger in episode three, which not only explains why Rocky’s in “Arnold,” but probably also why “Arnold” exists. Schwarzenegger continues to control his hyper-mediated destiny, and many people agree that his accomplishments as an American politician more than compensate for his earlier indiscretions. That was then, and this victory lap is for now until the foreseeable future.On Netflix now. Whole series was\\xa0screened for review.',\n",

       "  'review_text': 'One of the most spectacular and frustrating mixed bags of the superhero blockbuster era, \"The Flash\" is simultaneously thoughtful and clueless, challenging and pandering. It features some of the best digital FX work I\\'ve seen and some of the worst. Like\\xa0its sincere but often hapless\\xa0hero, it keeps exceeding\\xa0every expectation we might have for its\\xa0competence only to instantly face-plant\\xa0into the nearest wall.Then it hits the reset button and starts again—which, come to think of it, is what \"The Flash\" keeps doing over and over again narratively, with time, parallel universes, and the question of whether \"canonical\" events in the life of a person or a whole\\xa0dimension can be altered. From start to finish, it\\xa0suffers the double misfortune of being its own worst enemy, despite real thoughtfulness and an intriguingly unstable cocktail of genres\\xa0(slapstick comedy, family drama, heavy metal action flick,\\xa0philosophically driven science fiction adventure); and also\\xa0arriving on screens right after the release of \"Spider-Man:\\xa0Across the Spiderverse,\" a high watermark for both superhero movies and major studio animated features\\xa0that explores most of\\xa0the same concepts as \"The Flash\"\\xa0in a more aesthetically innovative way. Ezra Miller, whoseoffscreen brushes with the lawmake some of the film\\'s raunchier comedy land poorly, stars as twentysomething forensic scientist and secret superhero\\xa0Barry Allen, who feels like the \"janitor\" of the Justice League and\\xa0is still grappling with the impact of his mother\\'s murder and his father\\'s wrongful imprisonment for the crime. Here, again, in this very review, we encounter a double bind characteristic of \"The Flash\": it\\'s poor form to discuss the meatier parts of the movie because you can\\'t do that without describing the plot in detail, and\\xa0yet at the same time, a lot of it has already been \"spoiled,\" not just on social media and online forums but in the film\\'s own trailers and marketing material (Warner Bros. supplied the photo at the top of this review)\\xa0and on Wikipedia.If you read all that, you know whether to keep going or put the rest of this piece aside for later.For those still\\xa0reading: Remember the ending of the original 1978 \"Superman:\\xa0The Movie,\" where Christopher Reeve\\'s Superman has to choose between stopping a nuclear missile headed for Miss Tesmacher\\'s home state and preventing his great love Lois Lane from getting killed by an earthquake, tries to do both, loses Lois, then turns back time to resurrect her? Well, that sequence has\\xa0been expanded into an entire film and merged with the \"Back to the Future\" series, courtesy of Barry\\'s decision to try to go back in time and change one detail on the day his family was destroyed. Mom (Maribel Verdú) sent Dad (Ron Livingston) to the local supermarket to\\xa0fetch a can of tomatoes she needed for a recipe. When little Barry hears a commotion and comes downstairs, he finds Mom on the kitchen floor with a knife jammed into her bloody chest and Dad weeping over her corpse with one hand on the hilt. Barry surmises that he can use his Flash powers to return\\xa0to that fateful day, add a can of tomatoes to Mom\\'s supermarket basket, and save both parents. Anybody who\\'s seen a time travel movie (or read Ray Bradbury\\'s short storyThe Sound of Thunder)\\xa0knows it\\'s not that simple.Directed byAndy Muschietti(\"Mama,\" both \"It\" movies), from a script by ace genre screenwriterChristina Hodson(\"Birds of Prey,\" \"Bumblebee\"), \"The Flash\" deserves credit for taking its ideas and the pain of its characters seriously without devolving into glum, colorless machismo. When Miller enters what he believes is \"the past\"\\xa0(it\\'s actually an alternate timeline), he\\xa0not only encounters another version of himself with an intact, happy family but befriends and mentors the other Barry, discovering along the way how annoying he can be to others. Muschietti over-directs the pre-time-travel version of Barry, emphasizing his anxiety, clumsiness, and facial tics to the point where he seems like one of those schlemiels thatJerry Lewisused to play. But once the original Barry teams up with the other Barry, Miller keeps the schlemiel energy high for the second Barry while dialing it down for the original. This lets the first\\xa0Barry\\xa0mature in increments, part of the\\xa0traditional arc of a young hero.\\xa0The film showcases its finest effects in these mirror-image duets. The result\\xa0is the most convincing\\xa0instance\\xa0of a leading man playing opposite himself sinceMichael Fassbenderin \"Alien: Covenant.\" The shots of both Barrys even have a smidge of handheld shakiness that\\'s visual\\xa0shorthand for \"authenticity.\" Within a scene or two, you\\'ll likely forget that it\\'s one actor playing the same part and instead focus on what Miller does with both incarnations of the character.The master narrative of the DCEU defines Superman\\'s city-leveling battle with General Zod in \"Man of Steel\" as a character- and team-defining canonical event for every interlinked feature film\\xa0in the series. The aftermath of that contest figured into the plots and dialogue\\xa0of more than one\\xa0film, most notably \"Batman vs. Superman:\\xa0Dawn of Justice.\" When it\\'s referenced again in the film\\'s first act, you know Barry and Barry will have to deal with it again in another universe. Sure enough, here comes Zod with\\xa0his villainous teammates, scarab starships, armored shock troopers, and terraforming World Engine.The problem is, there\\'s no Justice League to team up against him, and only one superhero:\\xa0the Caped Crusader. Not Ben Affleck\\'s grizzled, Frank Miller-y Batman, but\\xa0the one\\xa0played byMichael Keatonin the 1980sTim Burtonfilms. Only he\\'s\\xa0older, more haggard, and even more alienated from the society he monitors. As the time-ripened version of\\xa0Burton\\'s Batman, essentially Bruce Wayne fused with\\xa0the long-haired hermit incarnation of\\xa0Howard Hughes,\\xa0Keaton gives the movie\\'s subtlest performance. He underplays and reacts\\xa0in a way that adds freshness\\xa0to a story that\\'s probably too dependent on recycled\\xa0situations and\\xa0makes Miller\\'s\\xa0jumpy, abrasive tendencies\\xa0easier to take. He\\'s the acting version of a shock absorber, smoothing the ride without slowing it down. Barry, Barry, and Bruce become convinced\\xa0that this universe\\'s Superman is trapped in a Siberian prison run by Russian mercenaries and fly there to bust him out. Turns out\\xa0he\\'s a she:\\xa0Kara Zor-El, Kal-El\\'s cousin,\\xa0aka Supergirl (Sasha Calle, rocking a modified pixie cut and a killer stare). Superman, we\\'re told, might still be out there somewhere, but his cousin (who was sent to protect him)\\xa0is a powerful ally who can stand up to Zod. When the modified four-person Justice League substitute confronts\\xa0Zod\\'s invading army, the movie proves that its obsessive referencing of the \"Back to the Future\" films was not just a\\xa0running gag.The reimagining of Zod\\'s attack is\\xa0this movie\\'s equivalent of the end of the second \"BTTF\" movie, where time-traveling adolescent Marty McFly (played byMichael J. Foxin our world, and in Barry\\'s byEric Stoltz, the actor\\xa0Fox replaced!) had to attend the same prom that ended the original \"BTTF\"\\xa0while avoiding a potentially time/space disruptive encounter with himself. (This movie\\'s decisions about what to save and what to delete from real world history\\xa0are weird;\\xa0I\\'d love to hear the logic behind erasing a lot of the DCEU superheroes from the second Barry\\'s universe while determining that \"Back to the Future,\" \"Footloose,\" and \"Top Gun\" and the first Chicago album were immutable occurrences.)The film\\'s big battle is its least convincing sequence\\xa0(parts of it look like cutscenes from an early-aughts\\xa0game). It\\'s too bad, because\\xa0it\\'s the most thought-provoking:\\xa0as Batman and the Flashes and Supergirl battle Zod,\\xa0the two Barrys disagree\\xa0on whether traveling back and forth along dimensional pathways will solve problems or add new ones.\\xa0Like most science fiction with even the thinnest\\xa0veneer of seriousness, \"The Flash\"\\xa0connects back to the godmother of science fiction, Mary Shelley\\'sFrankenstein, or, The\\xa0Modern Prometheus. Shelley\\xa0warned readers that\\xa0using science to mimic God or defy nature has bad consequences, and it\\'s better for the story\\'s\\xa0Prometheus figure to give up his illusions than continue traveling\\xa0a ruinous path. Is this the sort of film that will heed Shelley\\'s warning, or ignore it to give the hero what he wants and the audience the wish-fulfillment fantasies it craves and that superhero films nearly always endorse? Even the first two Reeve Superman films erred on the side of audience wish-fulfillment; the first film lets him turn back time, while the second has him erase Lois\\' knowledge of his secret identity with a super-kiss. \"The Flash\"\\xa0deserves credit for threading the eye of that\\xa0needle, giving audiences a somewhat hopeful\\xa0ending without negating the philosophical and scientific issues it raises elsewhere. Unfortunately, \"The Flash\" also has a countervailing tendency that undermines its best self. Even as it cleverly translates Shelley\\'s worries\\xa0into contemporary\\xa0comic book terms, it serves up callback after fan-wanking\\xa0callback to other versions of heroes and villains from film and TV, seemingly with no other purpose than to burnish Warner Bros\\' properties and\\xa0make the audience point to the screen and whisper the names of actors, characters, films, TV shows, and comic books that they recognize.\\xa0Batman, Batman, Batman, Batman, Superman, Superman, Superman, Superman, Flash, Flash, Flash, etc., keep popping up\\xa0scenes set in the \"Chrono-Bowl,\" a cosmic switching station\\xa0with a\\xa0design that alludes to clockwork gears, the concentric rings of chopped-down trees, theater-in-the-round, and a tribunal.And rather than find an artful, modest\\xa0way to repurpose library footage from earlier adaptations of DC comics—as, say, \"In the Line of Fire\" did with footage of a youngerClint Eastwoodfrom \"Dirty Harry\"—the actors who originally played them, many of whom died long ago,\\xa0have been scanned (or rebuilt)\\xa0as vaguely three-dimensional but uncanny grotesques, like Madame Tussaud\\'s wax figures laid over audio-animatronic puppets.\\xa0Remember the process\\xa0that \"reanimated\"Peter Cushingin \"Star Wars: Rogue One,\" and later served\\xa0up an even more unsettling\\xa0\"youngCarrie Fisher\" in the climax, paving the way for\\xa0a nearly expressionless\\xa0\"youngMark Hamill\" on \"The Mandalorian,\" and de-aged \\'70s movie\\xa0stars for various\\xa0legacy sequels?\\xa0It\\xa0gets trotted out and multiplied ad nauseam here,\\xa0even though the technology hasn\\'t improved much.The film\\'s principal cast also gets the zombie CGI treatment in the Chrono-Bowl, to visualize alternate realities. Some of the versions of these real, living\\xa0actors\\xa0with SAG cards and regularly updated IMDb pages\\xa0look faintly demonic. The torsos and hands aren\\'t anatomically credible. One has eyes that\\xa0point\\xa0in opposite directions like a gecko. Were the deadlines rushed and the digital effects artists exploited until quality control disappeared—a problem throughout the entertainment industry—or is the technology just not there yet?\\xa0And even if it ever does \"get there,\" will it ever not seem one (digital) step removed from wrapping a mannequin in corpse-flesh? Doing this sort of thing\\xa0in a purely animated format\\xa0moots such concerns. Everything in an animated comics\\xa0adaptation\\xa0is a drawing inspired by other drawings, and\\xa0therefore a representation of a thing that is\\xa0not meant to seem \"real.\"\\xa0Not so in live-action. \"Hey, that\\'s Actor X!\" gives way to, \"He looks kinda creepy and unreal,\" and the spell is broken.What a mess.\\xa0And what a shame, because what\\'s good about \"The Flash\" is very good. The movie\\xa0puts a lot of thought into what it wants to say and not enough into how it says it.\\xa0It avidly warns against a thing while at the same time\\xa0doing a version of that same\\xa0thing. Barry, driven by a desire to resurrect the dead, grapples with the ethics and advisability of actions that the film constantly performs, in small ways and large,\\xa0without breaking a sweat.Opens Friday, June 16th.',\n",

       "  'review_text': 'One doesn’t so\\xa0deeply\\xa0insist on calling themselves “the luckiest guy in the world”—as NBA superstar and sportscaster Bill Walton does—without facing bad luck. As we learn from this jollySteve Jamesdocuseries, the\\xa0towering and ebullient Walton is known for hyperbole, for liberally using the word “fantastic.” But in the humble Hall of Famer\\'s\\xa0mind, filled equally with Grateful\\xa0Dead jams and gratitude,\\xa0claiming the title is no stretch.Even without\\xa0today\\'s standards in sports, in which egos can be as big as paychecks, Walton is an enigma. In his heyday of playing center for the Portland Trail Blazers in the \\'70s, he was a humble hippie and outdoorsy guy, a vegetarian who stood out with his 6\\'\\xa011\" frame and\\xa0preferred mode of transportation (a bike). Due to a stutter, he hardly talked on camera. Walton focused most of all on becoming a great basketball player, having followed in\\xa0the long lunges of Kareem Abdul Jabbar at UCLA. He made Portland a home for his free spirit, legendary jump hook, and radical thinking. Walton’s life story is in great hands with director James, who has a rare touch for sports and the people who play them (“Hoop Dreams,” “Prefontaine”). In long drives, James nerds out about specific matches with those who shared the spotlight with Walton, especially when Walton made his way to the NBA Finals with the Blazers in ’77, and later the Celtics in ’86. But the interest in this formal but compelling project\\xa0is primarily about emotional memorabilia, and so we are treated with a bounty of off-the-cuff remembrances from his peers likeLarry Bird, Abdul Jabbar, World B. Free, and others.\\xa0James creates\\xa0the kind of reunions in which friends, family, and teammates are one and the same,\\xa0and anecdotes abound.\\xa0It makes you giddy to hear what was shared off the record, but in this rare case, it’s obvious\\xa0there wasn’t anything bad said about Walton.James tells this on-court career in loving detail, with a great focus on his emotional downfall when foot and knee injuries began to cause him to sit out for hundreds of total games, while contracts ensured he made money in the process. The documentary doesn’t quite complete the thought about how a bike-riding hippie could also become the highest-paid player at the time, but it does get at the emotional core of how those deals didn’t make Walton’s lack of playing, and the guilt from letting down his teammates,\\xa0any easier to accept. In less jovial moments, Walton has a stark seriousness on-camera\\xa0that hints at how he felt during his darkest years.Throughout James’ docuseries,\\xa0Walton is adorned in tie-dye shirts, proclaiming a love\\xa0for the Grateful Dead that\\xa0has been long-lasting and soul-filling. He discovered the music ofJerry Garciaand company while ascending as a basketball phenomenon, and he has only sought to pass on the vibes. (“Bill turned us all into\\xa0Grateful Dead fans,” Larry Bird remarks.) And the band helps tell his story: James places a full trove of Grateful Dead songs over Walton’s gameplay footage, and puts a tie-dye framing\\xa0to the doc’s more typical photo-driven sections. As “The Luckiest Man in the World” goes back and forth in his career, highlights fellow teammates like Maurice Lucas, and shows off Walton’s rocker-themed bedrooms,\\xa0the Dead’s presence here becomes instructive. This\\xa0four-hour docuseries is just jamming, man. As a \"30 for 30\" installment, the docuseries is beholden to filling hour-long episodes, so this one gives you everything.

       "  'review_text': 'Rob Savagehas proven twice that he can aim higher than “The Boogeyman,” an emotionally numbing horror movie and counter-intuitive self-challenge to make PG-13 horror scary. The filmmaker’s previous ventures—“Host,” about a haunted Zoom seance, and “Dashcam,” about a rapping anti-vaxxer’s live-streamed descent into hell—led with innovation and provocation. They’re as current as a WiFi signal and in turn, helped push horror forward. Primed to be this June’s Horror Movie of the Month, “The Boogeyman” is packed with familiar beats and little personality, the horror equivalent of a rising music star making a fan-friendly\\xa0Christmas album as their biggest project yet. To be fair, it’s not the best source. When \"The Boogeyman\"\\xa0short story came from “The Mind ofStephen King,” as this movie\\'s poster boasts, the mythic creature was stretched into a broad embodiment of fear and paranoia, conveyed in a two-person conversation and capped with a cheesy twist. Now, adapted here by “A Quiet Place” writersScott Beck&Bryan Woods, andMark Heyman, the dark-loving, door-bursting, child-terrorizing night monster’s significance is even broader with the significance of loss.Savage has thrown together a wonky seance for PG-13 horror movies from over a decade ago, with the smothering self-seriousness of recent “elevated horror” debates intact. It’s both soft around the edges from its reliance on peek-a-boo jump scares and also so deadset on being the latest gut-wrenching story about grief, this time dragging a therapist father,Chris Messina’s Dr. Will Harper, and his two daughters, Sadie (Sophie Thatcher) and the younger Sawyer (Vivien Lyra Blair) through the murk. The family’s mother passed away a year ago in a car accident.We sense the grief in the home’s stark atmosphere and the craven blacks and browns from production designerJeremy Woodwardand cinematographerEli Bornthat make darkness prevalent even in the daytime. But “The Boogeyman” does not have the emotional tact to make us feel such vital sorrow, only pity for the sisters (Thatcher, giving an excellent genre performance, is our lifeline not to lose interest entirely). Instead, in between some decent flashbang sequences where the girls are terrorized at night by something we only see in brief moments, we are stuck with a dour tone that numbs us and makes the film feel much longer than it is. The Boogeyman enters the Harpers\\' hollowed-out and extra creaky home in the form of Lester (from the short story), played here byDavid Dastmalchianat his most cryptic and also as a type of character development shorthand. After sharing a gruesome tale about the death of his children and a strong monster, he sneaks away and hangs himself in the dead mother’s art closet, planting the monster in their home.Lester’s suicide is just another death in the Harper world, and like the loss of Will’s wife and the children’s mother, he doesn’t really want to talk about it. In ways both proverbial and literal, Sadie and Sawyer are left in the dark. Sadie is a vulnerable loner and wears one of her mother’s dresses to school only for a bully to smash food all over it; Sawyer is so timid that she sleeps with a giant light ball. Both of them just want some inner peace, which is disrupted by aggressive bumps in the night and closet doors that suddenly burst open or slam shut.Savage likely got the job to direct “The Boogeyman” from how he previously used negative space and points-of-view, whether it’s the darkness behind someone on a candle-lit Zoom call or the fuzzy image of a figure standing in the middle of the road, waiting for a camera’s focus to adjust. There are only such passing thrills in this movie, which has a formulaic approach to scares that rely greatly on sound mixing, false alarms, and kids in danger. In the film’s first half, it makes for a sometimes uneasy—but hardly scary—atmosphere. The use of spare light and sound\\xa0is its most clever facet, like when Sawyer tumbles her big light ball into the unknown down the hallway, hoping she isn\\'t right about what\\'s on the other side.Throughout this modern-set story, Savage’s technological sense is curiously neglected. For all the talk about how the Boogeyman hates light, the script more or less ignores the handiness that a cell phone flashlight could have in thwarting its creature or inspiring more clever screenwriting. Such an omission\\xa0becomes glaring as the monster\\'s terror\\xa0loses its scant power over us later on. To put it in Stephen King-speak, isn’t Pennywise from “It” much more frightening as a clown in the distance than a giant spider up close? Savage’s “The Boogeyman” is a dated pest control saga in need of an update.Available in theaters on June 2nd.',\n",

       "  'review_text': \"My esteemed colleague Christy Lemire opened her review of “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” with a quote from her nine-year-old asking if he could see it again, so I think there’s some synergy in quoting my nine-year-old to open this one: “That might be the best movie I’ve ever seen.”“Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” explodes onto screens this week, building on the foundation of the masterful “Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse” with stunning animation, unforgettable characters, and complex themes. The first note I took after seeing it was “so much movie.” Like the work of a young artist who refuses to be restrained by the borders of the frame, “Across the Spider-Verse” is loaded with incredible imagery and fascinating ideas. It is a smart, thrilling piece of work that reminded me of other great part twos like “The Dark Knight” and “The Empire Strikes Back.” Like those films, it leaves viewers anxiously anticipating the next chapter (which will come in March 2024), and it earns its cliffhangers by grounding them in a story of young people refusing to submit to a concept of what a hero’s arc needs to be. “Across the Spider-Verse” opens just over\\xa0a year after the action of the first movie. Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) is back in her universe, trying to keep her identity secret from her father, George (Shea Whigham). When an alternate\\xa0version of the villainous Vulture (Jorma Taccone) drops into her reality, the bad guy ends up trailed by the intense Spider-Man 2099 (Oscar Isaac) and confident Spider-Woman (Issa Rae). They reveal to Gwen that they’re part of a secret Spider-Society that has been cleaning up inter-universe messes, capturing villains who end up in the wrong one and sending them home again. When Gwen’s identity is blown with her dad, she joins the Spider-Crew, correcting the errors of multi-verse.Of course, fans will remember that Miles Morales (Shameik Moore) is essentially one of those errors. The Peter Parker of his universe died trying to save him, and the spider that bit Miles was never supposed to be there. But it was. So now what? This story's backbone is about pushing back against determinism and moving forward with what's in front of you. Superhero culture has used multiverse stories to expand on the concept of potential, but this film (and I hope these themes really land in its sequel) suggests that it’s way more important to hold onto the reality in your hands than imagine all of the other ones that might have been. It’s about controlling your own fate more than giving into a scripted narrative of heroism. More than most superhero movies, it’s about empowerment instead of destiny. And that’s powerful stuff.Back to Miles. He’s in his version of Brooklyn, trying to balance being a good student with being a friendly neighborhood Spider-Man. He’s considering telling his mother, Rio (LunaLauren Vélez), and father, Jefferson (Brian Tyree Henry), the truth, but worries what it could do to their relationship if he does. One day, an odd duck that Miles thinks is just a “villain of the week” pops up in the form of The Spot (Jason Schwartzman). Formerly known as Dr. Jonathan Ohnn, the once-Alchemax-employee was forever altered by the first movie's action, able to control time and space through a series of portals. At first, it’s kind of cute how he tries to steal an ATM with a portal, but The Spot ends up being significantly more dangerous as his powers grow, opening passages that can destroy worlds. Naturally, the emergence of The Spot gets the attention of the Spider-Society, which sends Gwen and company back into the life of Miles Morales. The first sequence of their reunion is an absolute marvel as the two characters swoop and swing through the city, flirting their way through the sky. It culminates with a series of shots high above the city as the pair sits upside down, the skyline inverted behind them. It’s a quiet sequence in a movie that’s often very loud and a reminder of the film’s stunning visual confidence, just as striking in its calm as its noise.If the first film interrogated who gets to be a hero, the second film takes that further to ask how heroism is defined. Why does every hero’s arc have to be the same? Why does so much superhero mythology lean into the idea that it is only through tragedy that heroism can be born? In an era when superhero movies have taken over the culture, writersPhil Lord,Christopher Miller, & David Callahan use animation's freedom to unpack the structure of a world they know and love. It's a script that\\xa0earns every one of its 140 minutes, almost overwhelming in its abundance of ideas. (To be fair, my youngest also turned to me at one point and said, “I have no idea what’s going on.” He said it with a smile.)Of course, most will remember its imagery more than its ideas. DirectorsJoaquim Dos Santos,Kemp Powers, andJustin K. Thompsonbuild on the first movie's aesthetics\\xa0with one of the most strikingly conceived and executed animated films ever made. From the very beginning, the animators are using their form to do things that would never be possible in the MCU, and the art of “Across the Spider-Verse” feels even more self-assured than the first film. It’s not just that every action sequence would cost half a billion dollars in a live-action film. It’s that this freedom has been employed artistically and cohesively instead\\xa0of just extravagantly. Even in a film where characters defy time and space with every leap and dive, the choreography of the action is easier to follow than some of the Hollywood blockbusters released already this season. There’s a true craftsmanship to the action that’s breathtaking, especially in a late sequence when Miles breaks free from what the canon says he has to be. It helps greatly that the entire cast here brings their vocal A-game. There are so many celebrity voices here—including a number of cameos only villains would spoil—but I want to give some praise to Shameik Moore, who finds the perfect register for the odd intersection of youth, manhood, and heroism in which Miles finds himself. It’s a vocal performance with just the right blend of curiosity, vulnerability, and growing confidence. Steinfeld, Henry, Rae,Jake Johnson, Schwartzman, Velez,Daniel Kaluuya, Isaac—there’s no weak link. Everyone was clearly inspired by the creative potential of this script.Mediocre sequels repeat what came before, knowing that fans will return for more of the same. Great sequels build on what came before, enriching themes and setting the table for what’s to come. I wish that we weren’t seemingly in a blockbuster era of non-endings, but I feel like “Across the Spider-Verse” earns its open conclusion. It’s not just a way to guarantee that ticket buyers return. It’s not a threat to finish an incomplete story. It’s a promise to continue one that’s already so rewarding.In theaters tomorrow, June 1st.\",\n",

       "  'review_text': 'When do you know a relationship is real? Is it when you exchange glances that last a little too long so you can stare into each other’s eyes? Is it when you can’t stop talking to each other? Is it when you two do something together that feels more special than usual? Or is it when domesticity has set in, and you’re lying next to your partner discussing dinner plans? InCeline Song’s brilliant “Past Lives,” each subtle brush with affection is a spark that could—and sometimes does—lead to something more. The film explores the tender feelings of relationships at various stages, from budding playground crushes to adulthood’s alleged certainty. It’s the kind of nuanced movie that allows for self-reflection as well as entertainment, following two characters who illustrate how relationships—both fully realized and not—influence our lives. As a child in South Korea, Na Young (Seung Ah Moon) crushes on another boy in her class, Hae Sung (Seung Min Yim). Their relationship is just starting when her parents decide to move to Canada. The two childhood friends drift apart as their lives move on in different countries. Twelve years later, Na Young—now Nora (Greta Lee)—is an aspiring playwright in New York City. Hae Sung (Teo Yoo) is an engineering student back in Seoul who never stopped thinking about his childhood sweetheart. The pair reconnect over Facebook, and soon, their lives revolve around regular Skype calls, time differences be damned. However, with no sign that either one of them is willing to upend their early careers, the stream of video calls stop. Nora and Hae Sung’s lives continue over another 12 years before they reconnect again. Hae Sung finally visits New York and brings up all the feelings they thought they had left behind.Song’s feature debut is a masterclass in storytelling. A playwright before jumping into film, her focus is visually and narratively on Nora and Hae Sung, making the world around them seem to dreamily melt around them when they’re in each other’s company. There is a special connection between them, even if it never had the chance to take root physically. Every longing stare, late-night video call, unsent email, or excited smile details the trajectory of their relationship. The characters’ ample dialogue in Song’s script moves the audience not with dramatic overtures but with realistic conversations that reveal vulnerable emotions.Tenderly framed by cinematographerShabier Kirchner, “Past Lives” gives us careful close-ups of Nora’s face and Hae Sung’s expressive reactions as vividly as any line of dialogue. During their long-delayed reunion, the pair move seamlessly from basking in the glow of magic hour on Brooklyn’s waterfront to sunny trips on the ferry to street-lit walks in the East Village. It’s a playful comparison to the movie’s earlier setting in Seoul, where, as children, Hae Sung and Na Young took hilly routes home and play among modern sculptures in a park. No matter where they meet, the camera creates a sense of their connection, of the feeling that nothing else around them matters as much as this moment. While it is first and foremost a love story, “Past Lives” ventures beyond romantic yearning and burning questions. For Song, it’s also the chance to express feelings about the immigrant experience. Before leaving her home country, Nora’s mom justifies the couple’s choice to move the family abroad: “If you leave something behind, you gain something, too.” It’s a sentiment echoed through Nora’s life as her experiences lead her to a career in New York City and married life with a kindhearted writer named Arthur (John Magaro). But it’s a departure from the world she once knew as a child, and she confesses that she rarely even speaks Korean these days. When filling in her husband on meeting her girlhood crush, Nora confesses, “I feel so not Korean when I’m with him,” bringing up what sounds like insecurity about her own relationship with her culture.Song makes Nora and Hae Sung’s mutual background an integral part of “Past Lives,” like a secondary connection beyond their personal interests. He represents the life not lived because she moved away—that something left behind for something else to be gained. Their shared language is something her American husband can’t keep up with, functionally giving them a private conversation even when he’s at a bar with them. But sharing something doesn’t mean they share the same feelings, as seen in the movie’s running motif of In-Yun, the encounters in past lives that can influence your connections in the present. It’s something Nora laughs off with Arthur during their first meeting at a writers\\' retreat but that Hae Sung takes seriously when reflecting on his long-delayed visit to New York. They are, as the movie literally depicts, on two different paths. If at heart, they’re still the kids who first locked eyes with each other.With much of the film focused on Nora and Hae Sung, Lee and Yoo step up to the challenge with a lived-in sense of ease and grace. Their characters’ excitement to talk to one another is natural; their meandering conversations feel real. How Lee and Yoo look at each other creates the impression of a long backstory without so much as uttering a word. Their faces show their characters’ restrained emotions just under the surface of a polite smile, but just one heavy sigh is enough to break the tears out to mourn the love that was never meant to be, the life that was never theirs, and a childhood that grows more distant with the years. That mix of nostalgia, love, and remorse makes “Past Lives” so effective and lovely. The film\\xa0carries echoes of other movies like Wong Kar-wai’s “In the Mood for Love,” Richard Linklater\\'s \"Before Sunrise,\" andDavid Lean’s “The Passionate Friends,” but “Past Lives” so confidently belongs to Song—the way she envelopes the settings around her characters, how carefully she constructs their relationship over the years, and how quickly she returns that excited feeling to their conversations after years of silence. It takes a romantic view of the if-thens of what could have been, enjoying them like sandcastles washed away by time. We can delight in the memories of our past lives while acknowledging the loss of childhood things left behind, roads never taken, and relationships that were never meant for us.In theaters Friday, June 2nd.',\n",

       "  'review_text': 'Over two decades ago, when I had a big job at a big glossy magazine, my boss, the guy who hired me, got fired, and a new editor-in-chief was installed. I was sad and also mildly terrified. Largely because I was just like that whenever I was in a straight job situation—convinced that without my corporate sponsor, so to speak, I’d be found out as a fraud and kicked to the curb.I needn’t have worried, as I outlasted this new boss by almost another decade. He was a younger man, quite amiable and more actively plugged into certain parts of the zeitgeist than I. But I was very eager to please. One evening early in his tenure, he invited a group of senior staff out for drinks at the Plaza Hotel’s iconic Oak Bar. After we’d been sufficiently steeped in Scotch, he said to me, “You know, you strike me as the kind of guy who will watch the first 20 minutes of \\'The Wizard of Oz\\' while listening to side one ofDark Side of the Moon.” For you youngsters out there, this was a kind of meme at the time—some stoned so-and-so had discovered that in ways that were actually quantifiable (especially if you were, in fact, stoned), the imagery of “Oz” and the sounds of Pink Floyd synched up in an uncanny way. Like, you know, the twister coincided with some gnarly squiggly VCS synthesizer noodling. The thing was, at the time, and at all times since it had never even occurred to me to try this myself. I wasn’t THAT into Floyd, and I’d been around sufficiently to understand that ANYTHING can synch up if your individual will demands it. Still, I was, as I believe you can infer, eager to please, and I nodded my head avidly, and late that night, when I got home I tried the exercise, just so I wouldn’t be a liar, and was, to be honest, mildly impressed.Why did the synch work? Various reasons, none of them that Pink Floyd had planned.“The Wizard of Oz” is a work both archetypal and unique, and as the criticAmy Nicholsonnotes in the first chapter of this multi-essay documentary directed byAlexandre O. Philippe, its place in the firmament of world culture is almost an accident of fate. On its theatrical release in 1939, the movie flopped and was considered an expensive boondoggle. As with “It’s a Wonderful Life,” the film\\'s second life on television made “Oz” ubiquitous and beloved. In his chapter, “Kindred,” the filmmaker and writerJohn Watersrecollects first seeing “Oz” on television in his hometown in Baltimore, Maryland, and reckons thatDavid Lynchhad to have first seen it that way as well, either in Boise, Idaho, or Missoula, Montana, two of the very not-very-different-from-Kansas ultra-American locations where Lynch, the great American filmmaker and partial subject of this movie, grew up.\\xa0(And became, among other things, an Eagle Scout.)A visual artist by training, Lynch has never identified as a cinephile in the way giants like Scorsese and Spielberg have. In interviews, he’s been known to shrug off vast swaths of film history that journalists try to pin on him, looking for answers to the multitudes of enigmas in his own films. But \"The Wizard of Oz\" is one influence he will definitely cop to. In one of the best of the six chapters here, filmmakerKaryn Kusamarecalls attending a screening of Lynch’s 2001 \"Mulholland Drive\" at New York’s IFC Center, where Lynch sat for a Q&A afterward. There, he said, “There’s not a day that goes by that I don’t think about ‘The Wizard of Oz.’” And the references are strewn throughout Lynch’s films like stray seeds, from place and proper names (“Garland” is both a street name and the name of a character in “Twin Peaks”) to lots of outright wearing and heel-clicking of red shoes. The contributors here are Nicholson, Kusama, Waters, filmmakersRodney Ascher(“Room 237” and “A Glitch in the Matrix”),Aaron MoorheadandJustin Benson(\"The Endless\"), andDavid Lowery(“Pete’s Dragon”). Lowery is the one who most insistently connects Lynch’s work to his own by way of both “Oz” and “Peter Pan.” Philippe gives each of these narrators their own heads, so to speak, but still takes writing credit. I suspect he provided a lot of fodder for each chapter-speaker to work with, like the information that the obscure 1941 proto film noir “I Wake Up Screaming” uses “Somewhere Over The Rainbow,” by this time hardly a standard (“Oz” had flopped, remember), as a musical leitmotif throughout.The way Philippe organizes the hundreds of clips provides more startling and exhilarating moments per minute than most movies about movies can muster, although I can’t say that aficionados of ostensibly realistic cinema aren\\'t going to be too thrilled. Which is too bad, because among the many things this picture captures is how the fanciful worlds of “Oz” and Lynch illuminate the pain and splendor of the world we have to inhabit once we leave the magic realm of cinema.Now playing in theaters.',\n",

       "  'review_text': \"HBO’s four-part mini-series “Burden of Proof” asks two heartbreaking questions that are inverses of each other. What if you were convinced your parents had something to do with the death of your sister? It’s a hard thing to even fathom, and something that has shaped the entire existence of Stephen Pandos, whose sister Jennifer disappeared in the middle of the night almost four decades ago. He has spent years trying to solve the case, convinced that his father murdered his sibling and that his mom helped try to cover it up. Dad is a monster, so there's no great loss there,\\xa0but it’s forever warped his relationship with a mother who has not been able to even meet her grandkids. Of course, the other question is, what if he’s wrong? The excellent filmmakerCynthia Hill(“Private Violence”) probably presumed that “Burden of Proof” would be a feature film, but the saga stretched out over so many years that it shifted into a series. She spent a great deal of time over seven years with Stephen Pandos, capturing in real time his investigations into the life-shaping disappearance of his sister. The first half of the series is very procedural in a fascinating way as Stephen meets with experts, questions investigators, and spirals around the obvious conclusion that his parents know more than they claim.In February 1987, Jennifer Pandos simply vanished. A friend remembers speaking to her on the phone that night and hearing her father Ronald yelling at her to hang it up. Stephen alleges that Ronald had a violent temper, accusing him of choking and hitting his children. The next morning, Jen was gone. Mother Margie claims that her door was locked, and she was never seen again. The Pandos family lived in a gated, safe community. There were no signs of a break-in. There was, however, a note that only made the case more confusing. In and out of police custody, the note claims to be from someone with Jennifer, alleging that she’s fine, asking for money,\\xa0and quoting Jen herself. It made little sense. And it cast even more suspicion on the parents.They didn’t help their case. Stephen talks to relatives who claim that Jen’s parents never said anything about the case. The police accuse Mom of not returning calls, which could have been about finding Jen (suggesting Margie knew she wasn’t going to be found). Memory and reality start to blur. In one of his prison stints, Dad suggests he could show them where her body is. Mom fails a lie detector test. A handwriting examination can’t rule her out as the writer of the note. All signs point to a violent altercation and a cover-up. At least, as Hill presents it, it makes complete sense that Stephen would come to the conclusions that he draws. Things shift. A few other suspects come to the fore. The investigation continues to develop. And Stephen has to ask that horrible second question. What if he falsely accused his parents? Some of the series' back half is a bit purposefully vague in ways that verge on frustrating. True crime documentaries can be manipulative in how they withhold information, but Hill threads that needle just enough to make us feel as exhausted by this case as Stephen. She also clearly earns Stephen’s trust, and we come to share her obvious compassion for him. At one point in the final chapter, Stephen hears something horrible about the potential end of Jennifer’s life, and he closes his eyes as a sort of emotional response. I felt a great deal of sympathy for this man in that moment and others. While the case is still ongoing and this premiere will surely reopen the wounds of the last 36 years ago, I just hope Stephen Pandos can get some sleep. And find some peace.Premieres on Max on June 6th.\",\n",

       "  'review_text': '“Simulant,” a sci-fi murder mystery about humanoid robots and a potential robot uprising, has something that many other cheap “Blade Runner” and “I, Robot” rip-offs don’t: a clear sense that the loss of life, artificial or otherwise, should be sorrowful. When characters die in \"Simulant,\"\\xa0the movie’s creeping pace and dramatic inertia seem a little more tolerable. Slow down and look at this, the makers of\\xa0“Simulant” suggest whenever characters are either dying or facing their own mortality—this should hurt. These big moments aren’t impressive enough to make “Simulant” more than the bargain bin sci-fi pastiche it obviously is. But there’s some appreciable consideration shown to the movie’s Simulants, or Replicant-like synthetic humans, which gives a slight edge to this otherwise unconvincing robo-noir ripoff.Shameless and sleepy from scene one, “Simulant” begins with an Isaac Asimov-cribbed list of robot commandments that must be obeyed by all Simulants, an already socially integrated group of people-presenting robots. These four precepts are simple enough and hard-wired into the coding of every Simulant, basic stuff like you can’t kill a human, and you must obey human laws.A low-stakes chase ensues: Esme (Alicia Sanz) slowly gets away from government Agent Kessler (Sam Worthington), a robot-hunting dick working for the quasi-omnipotent Artificial Intelligence Compliance Enforcement agency. Kessler, unlike jaded sci-fi fans, is amazed that Esme could not only (momentarily) run away from him, but also disobey and even physically wound him. What is going on with these Simulants? A bland guy investigates.Meanwhile, another tale of the too-familiar future unfolds: dutiful but confused wife guy Evan (Robbie Amell) chases after his rich and very busy wife Faye (Jordana Brewster). He remembers surviving a car crash but can’t recall much more; she doesn’t want to talk about it but soon must. A little more than 20 minutes into the movie, we, too, learn Faye and Evan’s dark secret: he’s a Simulant of the real Evan, who died vehicularly. This canned revelation at least explains the weird tension between Evan and Faye (it’s not like it used to be, baby!). Evan’s discovery also inadvertently leads him to the shady Casey Rosen (Simu Liu), a Simulant expert who’s clearly not as harmless as he appears.(A MILD, BUT NECESSARY SPOILER) Eventually, Kessler’s search for answers leads him to Casey, but not before he watches Esme get re-programmed against her wishes. DirectorApril Mullenand writerRyan Christopher Churchillunderstandably dwell on this traumatic event because if Esme is more human than even tough-talking Kessler thinks, her feelings are not only “zeros and ones,” as he puts it. This scene’s probably the most impressive in the movie, not only because it’s affecting but also because it’s a clear declaration of intent. The makers of “Simulant” want you to imagine, despite all of our generic foreknowledge, that this robot’s pain matters. The rest of the movie isn’t as consequential because neither Evan nor Kessler’s dovetailing investigations really open up their characters or world in a major way. These guys ask the right questions, slowly and in visually flat medium close-ups, but they don’t pose deeper follow-ups, like what does it mean “to be more free” if you can only get that freedom by disobeying rules that were designed to protect other sentient peoploids?Both Esme’s destruction and Evan’s discovery only lead them back to Casey, a human plot device who talks generally about the necessity of hacking Simulants, so that they, too, can make their own decisions. But Kessler’s involvement doesn’t really matter, except to get to the next plot point, and Evan keeps hitting the same emotional wall whenever he seeks closure from his increasingly uncomfortable partner. Even Esme’s virtual death, represented in an appropriately chilly scene that contrasts Sanz’s tearful pleading with a cold computer programmer’s methodical deletion of Esme’s core memories, doesn’t cut deep enough. There are hints of a deeper movie here, but the one on-screen sticks too closely to stories and ideas we already know.An ambiguous ending, which hilariously ends with a long, hard leer at a naked woman’s backside, also isn’t ambiguous enough, and the movie’s already numbed protagonists only face dilemmas that reflect commercial stagnation instead of whatever the post-human condition might look like. There are spikes of emotional intensity throughout, but their visceral impact is negligible, given so many hand-me-down genre tropes. So when Casey tells Evan that abandoning his core robo-precepts would make Evan free of his programming “restraints,” it’s hard not to agree with Evan when he replies: “I don’t actually know what that means.” Casey tries to clarify, and Evan paraphrases him for us: he would be “more human” if he were liberated from his core precepts, but again: huh? “Simulant” never goes anywhere unexpected, making it hard to appreciate its creators’ unusual sensitivity.Now playing in theaters.',\n",
