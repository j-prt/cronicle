# Cronicle

This is a project I worked on in the summer of 2023. Cronicle is a multi-stage system for collecting articles from the web, uploading to cloud, and ultimately serving curated emails based on AI predictions. This repo is arranged largely as a collection of jupyter notebooks, python files, and scripts - from the stages of data collection to final product. 

Key technologies/libraries: 
- [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/)
  - BigQuery
  - GCS
  - Dataflow
  - Cloud Functions
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) 
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/)
